Preface
The aim of secondary education is to make the learners fits for entry into higher
education by flourishing their latent talents and prospects with a view to building
the nation with the spirit of the Language Movement and the Liberation War.
To make the learners skilled and competent citizens of the country based on the
economic, social, cultural and environmental settings is also an important issue
of secondary education.
The textbooks of secondary level have been written and compiled according to
the revised curriculum 2012 in accordance with the aims and objectives of
National Education Policy-2010. Contents and presentations of the textbooks
have been selected according to the moral and humanistic values of Bengali
tradition and culture and the spirit of Liberation War 1971 ensuring equal
dignity for all irrespective of caste and creed of different religions and sex.
The present government is committed to ensure the successful implementation of
Vision 2021. Honorable Prime Minister, Government of the People’s Republic of
Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm determination to make the country
free from illiteracy and instructed the concerned authority to give free textbooks
to every student of the country. National Curriculum and Textbook Board started
to distributed textbooks free of cost since 2010 according to her instruction.
Higher Mathematics, in line with Mathematics for classes nine and ten, plays an
important role as a powerful instrument to visualize real features of abstract
ideas as well as to enhance thinking skills. The use and application of higher
mathematics is everywhere in the huge development of ICT and Science.
Considering these things, the book Higher Mathematics has been introduced in
the secondary level. In this case, sincere attempts have been taken to make the
book easy and entertaining, giving due emphasis on the understandability of the
students.
Considering the challenges and commitments of 21st century and following the
revised curriculum the textbook has been written. The textbook has been revised
and reedited by a group of prominent educationist to make it learner friendly in
2017. I thank sincerely all for their intellectual labor who were involved in the
process of revision, writing, editing, art and design of the textbook.

Chapter 1
Set and Function
The concept and use of set are especially important in mathematics. For this
reason set has been discussed in Mathematics book of class VIII and IX. In this
chapter, we go beyond the materials covered there.

» Form universal sets, subsets, complement of a set, power sets;

> Form union, intersection and difference of sets;

» Prove the properties of set operations;

> Describe equivalent sets and explain the concept of infinite set;

>» Explain the formula for determining the union set, power set and verify it

with the help of Venn diagram and examples;

> Explain inverse function;

> Verify whether a relation is a function or not with the help of graphs;

» Draw the graphs of relations and functions.
Set
Any well-defined collection of objects of the real world or of the conceptual realm
is called Set. For example, S = {1,4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64,81, 100} denotes the set
of square of integers which are less than 10. The process of expressing set in this
method is called Tabular Method. Each of the objects forming a set are called
Elements of that set. If z is an element of a set A then we write x € A and if
Forma -1, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

2 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
x is not an element of a set A then we write z ¢ A. The aforementioned set S' is
written as S = {x : x is square number not greater than 100 }. This method is
called Set Builder Method.
Work: In the above discussion 1) Explain that S is a set. 2) Express S in
another way.

Universal Set

Suppose,
S = {x : za is a positive integer and 52 < 16}
T = {a: z is a positive integer and x? < 20}
P= {x : 2 is a positive integer and \/z < 2}
The elements of these three sets are formed by the set U = {z : x is a positive
integer}. U can be considered as the universal set for sets S,T, P.
If all the sets under discussion are included in a particular set, that particular set
is called the universal set.
Some Special Number Sets

N = {1,2,3,---} So the set of all natural numbers or positive integers.

Z ={--+ ,—2,—1,0,1,2,3,---} So the set of all integers.

Q={r:2= 7 Where p is any integer and q is any positive integers}. So the

set of all rational numbers.
R= {x: <2 is a real number} So the set of all real numbers.
Subset
If A and B are sets then A will be called the subset of B if and only if every
element of A are elements of B and it will be expressed as A C B. For example,
A = {2,3} is the subset of B = {2,3,5,7}. If A is not the subset of B then A Z B
is written. For example, A = {1,3} is not the subset of B = {2,3,5, 7}.
Example 1. If A= {x: 2 is a positive integer }, B = {0} and X = {z: z is
an integer}, then what is the relationship between A,B and X?
oo

Solution: Here, AC X, BC X, BZA. R

Chapter 1. Set and Function 3
Work: Suppose X = {x : x integer}.
1) Considering X as universal set, describe three subsets of X.
2) Describe two subsets of X where none of them are subsets of one
another.
Empty Set
Sometimes such a set is considered which has no element. This kind of set is
regarded as empty set and expressed as @ or {}.
Example 2. {z: a is a real number and x” < 0} is an empty set, because the
square of any real number can never be negative.
Example 3. F = {x: x, African countries who won the FIFA world cup till
2014} is an empty set, because no African country has ever won the FIFA world
cup till 2014.
Equality of Sets
If A and B sets have the same elements then A and B are regarded to be equal and
it is expressed as A = B. For example, A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {1,2,2,3,4,4, 4}.
It is to be noted that even though one element appears in a set repeatedly, it is
considered same as appearing once. A = B if and only if AC Band BC A. This
information is extremely important in proving the equality of scts.
Proper Subset
A is the proper subset of B if and only if A C B and A # B. So, every element
of A is also an element of B and B will have at least one element which is not an
element of A. For example, A = {1,2}, B = {1,2,3}. To express A as a proper
subset of B, A C B is written.
1) For any set A, A C A. This is because x € A => ZEA.
2) For any set A, @ C A. This is because if @ C A do not happen, © will
have one element x that A will not have. But this is never true because 2
is empty set. So, @ C A. It should be mentioned that empty set or @ is a
proper subset of any set.
o Difference of Sets
& If A and B are sets, A\ Bis {x :2€ A and z ¢ B}.

4 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
A\ B is called A delete B and the elements of A that are present in B are
discarded from A to form A\ B. A\ BCA.
Example 4. If A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and B = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} then
A\ B = {1,3,5,7, 9}.
Complementary Set
If U is an universal set and A C U, then complementary set of A is U\ A.
So, U\A={a:2€U and z ¢ A}.
If the elements of A is discarded from the universal set, then we will get the
complementary set of A and it will be expressed as A’ or A°.
Example 5. If universal set U is the set of all integers and A is the set of all
negative integers, then (with respect to U), the complementary set of A will be
A’ or A® = {0,1,2,3,---}
Power Set
The set of all subsets of A is called the power set of A and it is expressed as
P(A). It is to be noted that @ C A. For this reason, @, is also an element of
P(A).
P(A) Power Set
A= P(A) = {@}
A= {a} P(A) = {@, A}
A= {a,b} | P(A) = {@, {a}, {8}, A}
Work:
1) IfU = {1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8, 9, 10}, write down the following sets in tabular
method:
(1) A={x:2 EU, 5¢ > 37} (2) B={x:ceEU, £+5< 12}
(3) C={z:x2€U, 6<2x<17} (4) D={x:x2€U,2? < 37}
2) IfU = {c: 24 € Zt,1 < & < 20}, write down the following sets in
tabular method:
(1) A={zx: 2, is a multiple of 2} (2) B={zx:z, is a multiple of 5}
(3) C= {x : a, is a multiple of 10} %9
S
Aq

Chapter 1. Set and Function 5
In the light of your work, ascertain which among C C A, BC A, CC B
are true or false?

3) If A= {a,b,c,d,e}, then find out P(A).

Example 6. If A = {a,b} and B = {b,c}, show that P(A)UP(B) C P(AUB).

Solution: Here, P(A) = {@, {a}, {b}, {a,b}}, P(B) = {©, {}, {c}, {0, ch}.

.. P(A)U P(B) = {@, {a}, {5}, {c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}.

AUB = {a,b,c}, P(AUB) = {@, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, 5}, {a, c}, {b,c}, {a, b, c}}.

So, P(A) U P(B) C P(AUB).

Work:
1) If A = {1,2,3},B = {1,2},C = {2,3} and D = {1,3}, then prove,
2) If A= {1,2} and B = {2,5}, then prove,
(1) P(A) P(B) = P(ANB), (2) P(A)UP(B) 4 P(AUB).
Venn Diagram
Sometimes expressing set related information in diagrams is quite convenient.

These diagrams are named Venn diagram after the name of John Venn (1834 —

1923). This has been discussed briefly in the Mathematics book.

Example 7. The Venn diagram of A’, which is the complementary set of A

with respect to the universal set U:

U
a C+)
Union of Sets
If A and B are sets then their union of sets is AUB = {x : « € Aor
o «£ Ee Bh.
8 So, the set formed by the elements of both A and B is called AU B.

6 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
Intersection of Sets
If A and B are sets then their intersection of sets is AN B = {x: x € A and
x € Bh.
So, the set formed by all common elements of A and B is called AN B.
Example 8. Two subsets of universal set U = {0,1, 2,3, 4,5, 6, 7,8, 9} are
A = {x : 2 prime number } and B = {x : z odd number}.
So A = {2,3,5, 7} and B = {1,3,5, 7,9}.
So AUB = {1,2,3,5,7,9}, ANB = {3,5, 7},

A’ = {0,1,4,6,8,9}, B’ = {0, 2, 4,6, 8},

A’ UB! = {0,1,2, 4,6, 8,9}, 4’N B’ = {0, 4, 6, 8},

(AN BY = {0,1,2, 4,6, 8,9}, (AU BY = {0, 4,6, 8}.

Work: Show the examples mentioned above in Venn Diagram.
Disjoint Set
If A and B are such sets then AM B = @, then A and B are called disjoint
sets.
Example 9. If A = {x : x positive integer} and B = {x : x negative real
number} then A and B are disjoint sets, AN B = .
Example 10. IfA={x:2¢€RandO0<2< 2} and B={r:x€ N and
O0<a2<2} then BCA,AUB=A,ANB=B= {i,2}.
Example 11. If A={#:c¢€ Rand1l <a < 2} and B= {x:2¢€ Rand
O0<a2<1},AUB={r:x2€ Rand0<2z< 2} and ANB=@ So, A and B are
disjoint sets.
Cartesian Product Set
The Cartesian Product Set of two sets A and Bis Ax B = {(z,y):2€ Aandy€
Example 12. A= {1,2}, B= {a,b,c} are two sets. So the Cartesian Product
of these two sets is A x B = {(1,a), (1,6), (1,c), (2, a), (2, B), (2,c)}.

Chapter 1. Set and Function 7
Some Formulas of Set
Here in every case U is the universal set and sets A,B,C are the subsets of
U.
1) Commutative Law
(1) AUB=BUA (2) ANB=BnA
2) Associative Law
(1) (AUB)UC=AU(BUC) (2) (ANB)NC=AN(BNC)
3) Distributive Law
(1) AU(BNC) =(AUB)N(AUC)
(2) AN(BUC) =(ANB)U(ANC)
4) De Morgan’s Law
(1) (AUBY =A'NB’ (2) (ANB) =A'UB'
5) Other Formulas
(1) AUA=A,ANA=A (2) AUB=A,ANDG=fo
(3) AUU =U, ANU=A (4) ACB = BCA
(5) ACB = AUB=B (6) ACB = ANB=A
(7) ACAUB (83) ANBCA
(9) A\B=AnB
Verification of the Two Propositions of the Commutative Law
The shaded area of the following left sided diagram denotes both AU B and
BUA. So in this case, we see that AUB = BUA. On the other hand, the shaded
area of the right sided diagram shows both AN B and BA. So in this case, it
is seen that AN B= BNA.
A BU U
O) OO)
Here the verification shown above is done with the help of Venn Diagram. Now
let’s see this with a definite example.
Suppose, A = {1,2,4} and B = {2,3,5} are two sets.
w% So, AUB = {1,2,4}U {2,3,5} = {1,2,3,4,5}.
S Again, BU A = {2,3,5}U {1,2,4} = {1,2,3,4, 5}.

8 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
So in this case, AUB= BUA.

On the other hand, AN B = {1, 2,4} M {2, 3,5} = {2}
and BN A = {2,3,5} {1, 2,4} = {2}.

So here, ANB= BNA.
Verification of the Two Propositions of the Associative Law

The shaded area of the following left sided diagram denotes both AU (BUC)
and (AU B) UC. So in this case AU(BUC) = (AU B)UC. The shaded area of
the right sided diagram shows AN (BNC) and (AN B)NC. So here we can say
that (AN B)NC = AN(BNC).

Here the verification shown above is done with the help of Venn Diagram. Now
let’s see this with a definite example.

Suppose, A = {a,b, c,d}, B = {b,c, f} and C = {c,d, g}.

So, BUC = {b,c, f} U {c,d, 9} = {b, c,d, f, 9}
and AU(BUC) = {a,b, c,d} U {b, c,d, f, 9} = {a, b,c, d, f, g}.
Again, AU B = {a,b,c,d} U {8,c, f} = {a, 6, c,d, f}
and (AU B) UC = {a,b, c,d, f} U {c,d, g} = {a,b, c,d, f, g}.

So in this case, (AUB) UC = AU(BUC).
Again, BNC = {b,c, f} N {c,d, g} = {c}
and AN(BNC) = {a,b,c,d} N {c} = {c}.
Again, AN B = {a,b,c,d}/N {b,c, f} = {b,c}
and (AN B)NC = {b,c}N {e, d, g} = {c}. ~
So here, AN(BNC) =(ANB)NC. ES

A= {1,2,3,6}, B = {2,3,4,5} and C = {3,5,6,7}. Show the proof in Venn
diagrams for each set.

Observation: Each of the operations of union and intersection of sets is

distributive with respect to one another.

Proposition 1 (De Morgan’s Law). For any subset A and B of a universal set

2) Ax(BUC)=(Ax B)U(AxC)

According to the definition, A x (BNC)

So, Ax (BNC) = (Ax B)N(Ax C).
Some More Propositions of the Method of Sets
1) ACA holds for any set A.
2) The empty set @ is the subset of any set A.
3) If A and B are any sets, then A = B holds if and only if AC Band BC A.
4) If ACS, then A=2.
5) If AC Band BCC then, ACC.
6) For any set Aand B, ANBC Aand ANBCB hold.
7) For any set A and B, AC AUB and BC AUB hold.
Proof: Only proofs of two propositions are given. Do the others. co
4) Given, A C ©, again we know, @ C A. Therefore A = 2. 8

7) According to the definition of union of sets, A U B consists of the common
elements and all elements of A. So as per the definition of subset A C AUB.
By the same logic BC AUB.
Work: All of the following sets can be considered as the subset of universal
set U.
1) Show that, AN(BNC)=(ANB)N(ANC).
2) Show that, A C B if and only if one of the conditions below is fulfilled:

4) Show that,
(1) (ANB) =A'UB’ (2) (AUBUCY=ANBNC
(3) (ANBNCY=AUBUC’
One-One Correspondence
Suppose, A = {a,b,c} is a set of three persons and B = {30, 40, 50} is the set of
their ages. Moreover, suppose, the age of a is 30 years, the age of b is 40 years and
the age of c is 50 years. So it can be said that, there is an one-one correspondence
between the sets A and B.
Definition 1 (One-One Correspondence). If the matching of an element of
B with every element of A and an element of A with every element of B are
established, such matching is called an one-one correspondence. The one-one
correspondence between sets A and B is usually expressed as A + B and if any
element x of the set A corresponds to the element y of the set B, we write x © y.
Equivalent Set
Sy Let, A = {1,2,3} and B = {a,b,c} are two sets. An one-one correspondence
“between the sets A and B is shown in the figure below:

12 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
Vf
A — B

Definition 2 (Equivalent Set). Any sets A and B are regarded as equivalent
sets if one can establish an one-one correspondence A + B between them. A~ B
is written to indicate that A and B are equivalent. If A ~ B, one of them is called
equivalent to the other. Noted that, for sets A,B and C

1) An A

2) IfA~B,then BY A

3) IfA~Band B~C, thn A~C.
Example 13. Show that, A = {1,2,3,--- ,n} and B = {1,3,5,--- ,2n —1}
are equivalent sets, where n is a natural number.
Solution: A and B are equivalent, because the two sets have an one-one
correspondence as shown below:

a

Remarks: The one-one correspondence indicated above can be described by
ASB:k#2k-1, keEA.
Example 14. Show that, the set of natural numbers N and the set of even
natural numbers A = {2, 4, 6,---: , 2n,---}, are equivalent.
Solution: N = {1,2,3,---,n,---} and A are equivalent sets, because an one-
one correspondence between the sets NV and A can be established, which is shown 8
below. NQ

Chapter 1. Set and Function 13
Remarks: The one-one correspondence indicated above, can be described by
NGA:ne& 2nnEeN.
Observation: Empty set @ is supposed to be equivalent to itself. So, @ ~
gw.
Proposition 4. Every set A is equivalent to itself. That means, A ~ A.
Proof: If A = @, it is taken A ~ A. On the other hand, if A # @, every
elements makes a one-one correspondence with x by itselt to establish a one-one
correspondence AG A: rz, rEA. SOANA.
Proposition 5. If A and B are equivalent sets and B and C equivalent sets,
then A and C are equivalent too.
Proof: As A ~ B, we can associate every element x of A with a unique element
y of B. Again, since B ~ C, we can associate with that element y of B a unique
element z of C. So we can associate the element x of A with the unique elements
z of C. This association of the elements of A with the elements of C’ is a one-one
correspondence between them. So, A~ C.
Interval
If a and 6 are real numbers and a < 5,
1) (a,6)={z €R:a<-2z< }} is called open interval.
2) [a,b] = {x € R:a << < }d} is called closed interval.
x 3) (a,b) = {ec € R:a< «a < 5b} and [2,b) = {@ € R: a <2 < bd} are
N respectively called open-closed interval and closed-open interval.

14 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
Finite and Infinite Sets
Counting the elements of the set A = {15, 16,17, 18,19, 20,21, 22}, we see that
A has 8 elements. This counting is completed by establishing a one-one
correspondence of the set A with the set B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, as shown
below:
15 1
16 2
17 3
18 4
A 19 5 B
20 6
21 7
22 8
Definition 3 (Finite and Infinite Sets). A set whose elements can be fixed by
such counting, is called a finite set. If any set A is not a finite set, then it is
called infinite set.
1) Empty set © is a finite set, whose number of elements is 0.
2) If any set A and Jj, = {1,2,3,--- ,m} are equivalent, where m € N, then
A is a finite set and the number of elements of A is m.
3) If A isa finite set, the number of elements of A is denoted by n(A).
Note:
1) A = {1}, Jo = {1,2}, Js = {1, 2,3} is the finite subset of N and n(J1) =
1, n(Jz) = 2, n(J3) = 3 etc. In real sense, Im ~ Jm and n(Jm) =m.
2) Only the number of elments in a finite set can be fixed. So notation n(A)
implies that A is a finite set.
3) If A and B are equivalent sets and if one of them is finite, then the other
set must be finite and n(A) = n(B) will hold.
Proposition 6. If A is a finite set and B is a proper subset of A, then B will
be a finite set and n(B) < n(A) will hold.
Proposition 7. Set A is infinite if and only if there exists A and a proper eS

Number of Elements of Finite Sets

Elements of finite set A is denoted by n(A) and how to determine n(A) is
explained. Now, suppose n(A) = p > 0, n(B) =q>0 where ANB=@.

From the above mentioned one-one correspondence, we see that

Add) Bas Fo

So, n(AU B) = p+q = n(A) + n(B). From this we can say the following

proposition.

Proposition 8. If A and B disjoint finite set to each other, then n(AU B) =

Expanding the proposition, we can say, n(AU BUC) = n(A) + n(B) 4+ n(C).

Similarly n(A UU BUCUD) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) + n(D) ete,

where A, B,C, D sets are disjoint finite set to one another.

Proposition 9. For any finite set A and B, n(AUB) = n(A)+n(B)—n(ANB).
Sy Proof: Here, A\ B, AN B and B \ A are disjoint sets to each other[See Venn
\ Diagram].

(os)

So, A= (A\ B)U(ANB) and B= (B\ A)U(ANB)

Therefore, AUB =(A\ B)U(ANB)U(B\ A)

So, from (1) we get, n(A \ B) = n(A) — n(AN B)

and from (2) we get, n(B \ A) = n(B) —n(AN B)

Now, putting n(A \ B) and n(B \ A) in (3), we get

n{(A U B) = n(A) — n(AN B) + n(B) -n(AN B)+n(AN B)

“. n(AU B) = n(A) + n(B) -—n(AN B)

Work:

1) In each of the following cases, describe all possible one-one
correspondence between A and B:

(1) A= {a,b}, B= {1,2} (2) A= {a,b,c}, B= {a,b,c}

2) For each one-one correspondence described in the above question,
describe the set F = {(z,y): 2 € A,y € B} and x © y in the tabular
method.

3) Suppose, A = {a,b,c,d} and B = {1,2,3,4}. Describe a subset of F
of A x B in such a way that associating the second component of each
ordered pair in that subset with its first component yields a one-one
correspondence between A and B where, a + 3.

Set in Solving Real-Life Problems
Venn diagrams are used to solve real-life problems. Here it is noted that the
elements of each set which will be written down in Venn diagram, is shown through
some examples.
Example 15. Out of 50 persons, 35 can speak English, 25 can speak both
English and Bangla and every one can speak at least one of these two languages.
How many persons can speak Bangla? How many persons can speak only Bangla?
Solution: Let, S be the set of the 50 persons, E' be the set of persons among them
who can speak in English, B be the set of persons who can speak in Bangla.
S 50
So according to the question, n(S) = 50, n(Z) = 35, n(EN B) = 25 and S =
EUB. Suppose, n(B) = z.
Then from, n(S) = n(E U B) = n(£) + n(B) — n(EN B), we get
50 = 35 + x — 25 or, c = 50 — 35 + 25 = 40 So, n(B) = 40
.. 40 persons can speak in Bangla.
Now, the set of those who can speak in only Bangla is (B \ E).
Let, n(B\ E) =y.
As the sets 2 B and (B \ £) are disjoint and B = (EM B) U(B\ E) [See Venn
Diagram]
Forma -3, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

18 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
Therefore, n(B) = n(EN B)+n(B\ E).
“. 40 = 254+ -y or, y = 40 — 25 = 15 So, n(B\ £) =15
., Only 15 persons can speak in only Bangla.
So, 40 persons can speak in Bangla and 15 persons can speak in only Bangla.
Example 16. Each of the 35 girls in a class likes at least one activity among
running, swimming and dancing. Among them 15 girls like running, 4 like all three

1) Let, set J = those who like running, S = those who like swimming, D =
those who like dancing. Now let’s look at the Venn Diagram shown above.
2) From the Venn Diagram J’ = {the girls who do not like running}.
So, n(J’) = 35 — 15 = 20 or, 22 + + 2 = 20 or, 3a = 18 or g = 6.

Relation
We often consider different types of relations among the elements of set X or
among the elements of set X and set Y. For example, greater-lesser relation in
the set of natural numbers, brother-sister relation in a family, relation of age with
your classmates in your recent birthday. For further information regarding this
context, please refer to the Mathematics book of class 9-10.
Example 18. Suppose A = {0,1,2,3} is a set. The x < y relation existing
between the elements of the set A can be described by subset of A x A which is
S = {(0,1), (0, 2), (0,3), (1, 2)(1, 3), (2, 3)}, where for ordered pairs included under
S (first entry) < (second entry). Here S is the < relation described under A.
Example 19. Suppose, a is the father, b is the mother, c is the elder son, d
is the younger son, e is the daughter, f is the wife of the elder son in a family.
Assuming the set of members of the family as F, we get F = {a,b,c,d,e, f}.
The brother relation in set /’, which means the brother relation between x and y
can be described by B = {(c,d), (c,e), (d,c), (d,e)}, where the first entry of the
ordered pairs under set B is the brother of the second entry of the same ordered
pair. The set B denotes the brother relation of set F’.
Definition 4 (Relation). if two sets are X and Y, any subset of their cartesian
product set X x Y is called relation from X to Y. So, RC X x Y is a relation
from X to Y.

Function

The idea of function is as important as sets in mathematics. In practical need,
relations between two variables or two sets are considered.

Example 20. Relation between the radius and circumference a circle is

expressed as p = 2ar where variables r and p denote the radius and the

circumference of the circle respectively. Here for every possible value of r, one
and only one value of p is definite. We say that, variable p is a function of
variable r which is written as p = f(r), f(r) = 2ar. In this functional relation

the function has been assumed to be defined with values of r taken from set X

and values of p from set Y. This function s treated as relating X to Y

{(r,p):r EX andpeY p=2nr}. The idea of relations has been explained in

the Mathematics book of class 9-10.

Definition 5 (Function). If X and Y are sets and under any rule, every element

of set X is associated with one and only one element of set Y then that rule is

called a function described from X to Y. These types of functions are denoted
with symbols such as f, 9, F,G etc.

Definition 6 (Domain and Codomain). If a function f is from set X to set

Y, then this is expressed as f : X + Y. X set is called domain of function

f :X — Y, while set Y is called codomain.

Definition 7 (Image and Preimage). If under function f : X + Y, xz € X is

associated with y € Y, then y is called image of x and z is called preimage of

y under this function and it is expressed as y = f(z).

Definition 8 (Range). Under function f : X — Y, the set of the elements of

Y which are images of any element of X is regarded as range of function f and

it is expressed as "range f”. So, range f = {y: y = f(x) where x € X} = {f(z):

xz € X}. Noted that range f is the subset of codomain Y.

Function can be described in different ways. Let’s take a look at the following

examples.

Example 21. f:2 — 2£+1, « € Z; describes a function from the set

of integers Z to Z. Under this function image of x is y = f(z) = 2241;

Forma -4, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

26 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
the domain of the function, domain f = Z and range of the function, range
f={y:y=2r+1, x2 € Z} is the set of all odd integers.
Example 22. A set of ordered pairs
F = {(0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), (2,4), (—2,4), (8,9), (—3,9)} describes a function,
whose domain is set of first entries of the ordered pairs under F' and range is set
of second entries of the ordered pairs under F’.
So, domain F = {0,1,—1,2, —2,3, —3} and range F = {0,1, 4,9}
If you look closely you will see in this case that under F’, x € image of F’, F(x) =
x*. Noted that, set of an ordered pair will only define a function when first entries
of different ordered pairs will be different.
Example 23. Considering the domain and range of the function F’ described
below as A and B respectively, the function can be described with a diagram,
where one and only one arrow sign started from every point of set A and ends
at one and only one point of set B(left sided diagram). Noted that, a set Y can
be regarded as the codomain of the function, whose subset can be drawn with
B(right sided diagram).

Chapter 1. Set and Function 27
1) Under the left sided diagram drawn above, a > 1,b + 2,c > 4. This
function is one-one but not onto since there exists no preimage of 3.
2) Under the diagram drawn in the middle above, a + 1,b > 2,c > 2. This
function is onto but not one-one since 2 is the image of 6 and c.
3) Under the right sided diagram drawn above a —- 2,b + 1,c > 3. This
function is one-on and onto. In the last case, for every element of codomain
D, domain A has one and only one element which is definite. As a result,
a function is described from D to A, which is called the inverse function of
given function.
Definition 9 (Inverse Function). Suppose, f : A > B is a one-one and onto
function. If a function g : B — A is described where for every b € B, g(b) =a
if and only if f(a) = 6, that function g is defined as the inverse function of f.
This is denoted as f~! so, g = f-1.
If the function is f in the right-sided diagram drawn above, f~! : D A and
f-'() = 6, f-1(2) = a, f-1(3) = c. However, in case of the other two diagrams,
an inverse function is not possible.
Example 24. Suppose, A = {2,3,5,7} and B = {1,2,4, 7,10}. Those elements
of B which are divisible by the elements of A are shown below by drawing a
diagram using arrow signs:
A B
SE
Ae
Here we now form the set D = {(2, 2), (2,4), (2, 10), (5, 10), (7, 7)} of all ordered
pairs which describe the relation of disivility. In the set D, the first entries of the
included ordered pairs belongs to A while the second entries belong to B and are
divisible by the first entries. So, DC Ax Band D= {(z,y):c€ A,y € Band
y is divisible by x }, Here the set D is a relation from set A to set B.
Example 25. Consider the set of ordered pairs of real numbers L = {(z,y) :
8 céR,y€ Rand z < y}. a < 6 for two real numbers a,b if and only if it is
S (a,b) € L. Therefore, the set L describes the relation of lesser or greater.

f:2—47So, f(2) =7 or, 2m+c=7----++(1)
f:4—-1 So, f(4) = lor, 4m+c=—1------(2)
From (1) and (2) we get m = —4 and c= 15

Remarks: A function F' can be determined if its domain is defined and its image
is uniquely specified for each element x of the domain. Sometimes the domain
is kept implied. In such cases we take that specific set as domain, whose F(z)
remains fixed for its each element.

Onto Function
In the diagram we consider the sets A = {1,2,3} and B = {5,7,9} under the
function f where 1 5, 2 7 and 3 > 9. So, every clement of B is an image of
an element of set A. This type of function is called onto function.

Definition 11 (Onto Function). A function f : A + B will be called the onto
function if for every b € B, there exists a € A such that f(a) = b. So, B = range
f.
Example 34. If two functions f : R > Randg: R —- R are defined by
f(z) = +5 and g(x) = x — 5 respectively, then show that, f is an inverse
function of g.
Solution: The function f is one-one, since

If f(a1) = f(ze), then a1 +5 = 22 +5 or, 21 = Zo.
Again, function f is onto, since

If y = f(z) thence +5=yor,c=y—-5eER.
So, there is an inverse function f~1.
If f-1(z) =y then f(y) =x or, y+5=for,y=x-—5

Graphs of Relations and Functions
Graphs are useful geometrical representations of functions. To draw the graph of
y = f(z), we draw a pair of perpendicular bisectors XOX’ and YOY’ through a
point O. O is called the origin, XOX’ is called the x-axis while YOY’ is called
the y -axis.
For drawing the graph of y = f(x), pairs of values of independent variable x
and dependent variable y need to be tabulated between an interval a < x < b.
Then the limited amount of points of the tabulation are placed on the plane zy.
By joining the obtained points with a straight line or a curved line, we can get
the graph of function y = f(z). In the Mathematics book of class 9-10, the
initial concepts about graphs have been imparted. Here, the linear function, the
quadratic function and the construction of the graphs of the circle have been
discussed.
Linear Functions
The general form of linear function is f(z) = ma + b where, m and 0 are real
numbers. The graph of this function is a line whose slope is m and the intercept
of y axis is b.

a=1, b=—4, c=-1. Soy = az*+bx+c can be written as y = 2? —4rz—1. We

Graph of a Circle
Noted that p, g and r are constants and if r # 0 then in R, the graph of a relation
S ={(z,y) : (x —p)? + (y— 4)? = 7°} is a circle whose centre is the point (p,q)
and radius is r (see the Mathematics book of class 9-10). In the graph paper,
by plotting the point (p,q) as centre and taking r as radius we can draw a circle
which will represent the graph.
Remark: If the solution set of a relation is infinite, the known system of drawing
its graph is to plot sufficient numbers of representative points of solution in the
graph paper and then to join them, so that the graph of the relation can be clear.
But if the graph of relation is a circle, using compass will make the work easier
and beautiful, so we use the latter means.
Example 35. S = {(z,y):27+y? = 16}
Therefore, the graph of S is a circle z? + y* = 4”, with centre (0,0) and radius

Algebraic Expression
We are familiar with various types of algebraic expressions. When one or more
numbers and symbols representing numbers are combined meaningfully by one
or more than one of +, —, X, +,, power or rational sign, a new symbol
representing numbers is created. It is called an algebraic expression or in
brief expression. For example, each of 22, 2x + 3ay, 62 + 4y?+a+ V2 ete, is
an algebraic expression.
At the end of this chapter, students will be able to -
>» Explain the concept of a polynomial;
> Explain with example the concept of a polynomial with one variable;

a polynomial;
>» Explain homogeneous expressions, symmetric expressions and cyclic
expressions;

Variable, Constant and Polynomial
In any discussion, a literal symbol representing a number may be a variable or
a constant. If such a symbol denotes any unscheduled element of the number
set consisting of more than one elements we call the symbol a variable and the
set is called the domains. If the symbol denotes a definite number, it is called a
constant. In any discussion a variable can take any value from its domain, but
the value of a constant remains fixed all through. A polynomial is a special type
of algebraic expression. In a polynomial there are one or more terms and each
Forma -6, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

A2 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
term is a product of a constant and a non-negative integral power of one or more
variables.
Polynomial of One Variable

Let, z bea variable. Then, (2) a, (é) ar-+b, (iti) ax?-+br+c, (iv) az?+br*+cr+d
; expressions are polynomials of the variable x; where a, b, c, d are fixed numbers
constants. Generally, the terms of a polynomial of the variable x have the form
cx’, where C’ (independent of 2) is a fixed number (which may be zero) and p is
a non-negative integer. If p is zero, the term becomes C’ , and if C is zero, the
term is suppressed in the polynomial. C is called the coefficient of z? in the
term cz? and p is called the degree of the term. The largest of the degrees of the
terms appearing in a polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. The
term having the largest degree is called the leading term and the coefficient of
the term having the largest degree is called the leading coefficient; the term
with degree 0, that is, the term independent of variable z, is called the constant
term. For example, 2° — 32° — zt + 2x — 5 is a polynomial of the variable z,
its degree is 6, its leading term is 27° leading coefficient is 2 and constant is —5.
If a # 0, the aforesaid (i) the degree of the polynomial is 0, (41) the degree of
the polynomial is 1, (ié¢) the degree of the polynomial is 2, and (iv) the degree of
polynomial is 3. Any non zero constant (a # 0) is a 0 degree polynomial of the
variable (consider a = az°). The number 0 is considered a zero-polynomial and
the degree of a zero-polynomial is considered undefined
A polynomial of the variable xz is usually arranged in descending order of the
degrees x of its terms (the leading term appearing first and the constant term
appearing last). This arrangement of a polynomial is called its standard form.
For convenience of using, polynomials of the variable z are denoted by symbols
like P(x), Q(x) et cetera. For example, P(x) = 2x? + 7x +5. Such symbol P(x)
indicates that the values of a polynomial depend on the values of x. If a specific
number a is substituted for x in the polynomial, the value of the polynomial for
that value of z is denoted by P(a).
Example 1. if P(x) = 32° + 22” — 7x + 8, then find the value of P(2), P(—2),
and P (5).

The terms of such polynomials have the form cx?y? where C is a definite number

az?y? is C and the degree of the term is p+ q. In such polynomial, the mentioned
largest of the degrees of the terms is called the degree of the polynomial. Such
polynomials are denoted by P(x,y). For example, the polynomial P(z,y) =
823 + y? — 4x? + Try + 2y — 5 has degree 3 and P(1,0) =8-—4-—5=-1.

Multiplication and Division of Polynomial
Addition , Subtraction and Multiplication of two polynomial is always polynomial,
but division of polynomial may or may not be polynomial. For example, if we
divide x by x°, take the answer as x~?, then it is not a polynomial but if we take
x as a remainder and result as 0, it is a polynomial.
Example 2. What is the result of the multiplication of (x? + 2) and (x + 1)?
Here, the result of multiplication of (x? + 2) and (x + 1) is (x? + 2)(r +1) =
x? + 2? + 22+ 2, which is a polynomial with a degree 2+ 1 = 3 and leading
co-efficient 1 x 1=1
Example 3. What is the quotient when (x? + 1)(z — 6) is divided by 2x? + 3?
Here, Dividend P(x) = (x? + 1)(z — 6) = 2? — 6z? + x — 6 with a degree 3 and
leading co-efficient 1.
And Divisor Q(x) = 22? + 3 with a degree 2 and leading co-efficient 2.
1
Dividing P(x) by Q(z), we get Quotient, F(x) = gz 3, and Remainder, R(x) =
-3 +3. Hence, Quotient, F(x), is a polynomial with a degree 3 — 2 = 1 and

If both P(x) and Q(x) are the polynomials of the variable x and if degree of

obtain a quotient F(x) and a remainder R(x), where,

1) Both F(z) and R(z) are the polynomial of the variable z

2) degree of F(x) = degree of P(x)— degree of Q(x)

2 Identity

S If the two polynomials P(x), Q(x) for all x are equal, their equality is called the

46 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
referred to as identity of the polynomials; sometimes this is indicated by writing
P(z) = Q(z). In this case the two polynomials P(x) and Q(x) are the same. The
sign = is called the identity sign. Generally, the equality of the two algebraic
expressions is called the identity, if the domain of anyone variable of the two
expressions is the same and for the values included in the domain of the variables,
the values of the two expressions are equal. For example, x(z + 2) = x? + 2z,
(x+y)? = 27 + 2zy + y? are an identity.
Remainder and Factor Theorems
In this section we shall deal with polynomials of one variable only. First, we
consider the two examples.
Example 4. If P(x) = x? — 5z +6 divide P(x) by (x — 4) and show that the
remainder is equal to P(4).
Solution: Let’s divide P(x) by (x — 4) like the following and the remainder is
2.
z—A)z*-52+6(x-1
x? — 4x
—-x+6
-@+4
2
Since P(4) = 4? — 5(4) + 6 = 2, remainder is equal to P(4).
Example 5. If P(x) = az’ + br +c, divide P(x) by z — m and show that the
remainder is equal to P(m).
Solution: Divide P(z) by x — m like the following and the remainder is am? +
bm +c.
x — m)azx? + ba + c(ax? + amz + am? +b
ax? — ama?
amz? +br+c
ama? — ama
(am? + b)x +c
(am? + b)xz — (am? + b)m
am3 + bm +c =
N

Chapter 2. Algebraic Expression 47
Again, P(m) = am? + bm +c. So when P(z) is divided by m remainder is equal
to P(m).
These two examples suggest the following propositions.
Proposition 1 (Remainder Theorem). If P(x) is a polynomial of positive
degree and a is any definite number, the remainder of the division of P(x) by
xz —a will be P(a).
Proof: If we divide P(x) by z—a the remainder is either 0 or a non-zero constant.
Suppose, the remainder is R and the quotient is Q(z), then by law of division, for
all z.
P(t) = (e-a)Q(a) + R
Putting x = a in (i) we get, P(a) = 0-Q(a) + R=R. Therefore, the remainder
of P(x) upon division by r—a is P(a).
Example 6. Divide P(x) = 2° — 827+ 62z+60 by z+2 and find the remainder.
Solution: Since x + 2 = a — (—2) = (« — a) where a = —2,
Hence, remainder = P(—2) = (—2)° — 8(—2)? + 6(—2) + 60 = 8
if is proved by following Proposition 1.
Proposition 2. If P(z) is a polynomial of positive degree and a # 0, the
b
remainder of the division of P(x) by ax + b will be P (-2) .
Example 7. Divide P(x) = 36x? — 8a + 5 by (2x — 1) and find the remainder.
: a 1 1\? 1
Solution: The remainder is P 3) 36 3 —8 2 +5 = 9—4+5 = 10
Example 8. If dividing P(x) = 523 +6x? —ax+6 by z—2 results the remainder
6 then find the value of a.
Solution: Dividing P(x) by x — 2, we will get the remainder
P(2) = 5(2)8 + 6(2)? — a(2) +6 = 40 + 24 — 2a + 6 = 70 — 2a
By the given condition, 70 — 2a = 6 or, 2a = 70 — 6 = 64 hence, a = 32
Example 9. If P(z) = 2° + 527 + 6x + 8 yields the same remainder upon
division by z — a and x — b where a # b, show that, a? +b? +.ab+5a+5b+6 =0.
oO
® Solution: Dividing P(x) by x—a yields remainder, P(a) = a? +5a?+6a+8,

48 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
and dividing P(x) by z — b yields remainder, P(b) = 6? + 5b? + 6b + 8.
by the given condition, a? + 5a? + 6a + 8 = b? + 5b? + 6b+8

or, a® — 6? + 5(a? — b?) + 6(a — b) = 0

or, (a — b)(a? + b? + ab + 5a + 5b +6) =0
(2 +0? + ab+5a+5b+6) =0, since a #b
Proposition 3 (Factor Theorem). If P(x) is a polynomial of positive degree
and if P(a) = 0, so x — a is a factor of P(x).
Proof: The remainder of P(z) upon division by z—a is P(a) = 0 [given]. This
means, the polynomial P(x) is divisible by x — a. .. x — a is a factor of the
polynomial P(x).
Converse of Factor Theorem
Proposition 4. If z—a is a factor of the polynomial P(x), show that P(a) = 0.
Proof: Since x — a is a factor of P(x), there exists a polynomial Q(x) that
P(x) = ( —a)Q(a). Putting x = a we get, P(a) = (a — a)Q(a) = 0- Q(a) = 0.
Example 10. Show that x —1 will be a factor of P(x) = az? + bz? + ca +d, if
and only ifa+b+e+d=0.
Solution: Suppose, a+b+c+d=0
then, P(1) =a+6+c+d=0 [by conditions]
Therefore, z — 1 is a factor of P(x). [by factor theorem]
Now let’s assume x — 1 is a factor of P(z).
So, by the converse of factor theorem we get, P(1) =0ie,at+tb+c+d=
0
Remarks: In general, z — 1 will be a factor of a polynomial of positive degree if
and only if the sum of the coefficient of the polynomial is 0.
Example 11. Suppose, P(x) = axz* + bz? + cx +d is a polynomial with integer
coefficients, a # 0, d # 0; suppose x — r is a factor of P(x) show that, °6

1) If, is an integer, r will be factor of the constant term. &

Chapter 2. Algebraic Expression 49

2) Ifr= i; is a rational number in its reduced form, p will be a factor of d,
and q will be a factor of a.

Solution:

1) From factor theorem, we get, P(r) = ar? +br?+cr+d=0 or, (ar? +
br +c)r = —d Since (ar? + br +c), r and d are integers, this implies, r is a
factor of d.

2) From the converse of factor theorem we get,

P(r) = ar? + br? +cr+d=0
3 2
or, p(?) =a(?) +0(2) +e(2) +d=0
qd q qd qd
or, ap? + bp*q + cpq? + dg? =0-+++++(1)
From (1) we get (ap? + bpg + cq?)p = —dg?------ (2)
and (bp? + epq + dq?)q = —ap?---+++ (3)
Now, ap? + bpq + cq”, bp? + cpq+ dq’, p, q, d, a are integers.
From (2) we get that p is a factor of dq®; from (3) we get that q is a factor
of ap. But p and q, have no common factor except +1. Therefore, p is a
factor of d, and q is a factor of a.
Note: From the above example we see that to determine the factor of integer
coefficient of the polynomial P(x) by factor theorem first we can test P(r) and
then P (“) where r is the factor with (r = +1) with the constant of polynomial
and s is the factor with(s = +1)leading coefficient of the polynomial.
Example 12. P(x) =Resolve the polynomial x? — 6x? + 11x — 6 into factors.
Solution: All coefficients of the given polynomial are integers and constant =
—6, leading coefficient= 1
Now if r is an integer and P(x) any factor of the form x —r then, r will be factor
of the constant term —6. So possible values of r are +1, +2, +3, +6 any of it.
Now for these values of r verify values of P(z).
P(1)=1-6+11-6=0, ..2—1, is a factor of P(x).
P(-1) =-1-6-11-640, ..¢+1, is not a factor of P(2).
P(2) =8— 24+ 22-6=0, .. 4-2, is a factor of P(x)
Forma -7, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

50 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
P(—2) = —-8 — 24-22-60, ..2 +2, is not a factor of P(x).
P(3) = 27 — 544 33-6 =0, .. x —3, is a factor of P(z).
As degree of P(x) is 3 and we have found three factors of degree 1 So if P(x) has
another factor it will be a constant.
“. P(x) = k(x — 1)(a — 2)(a — 3) where k is a constant.
Equating the coefficients of the highest power of x appearing on both sides, we
get, k= 1
Therefore, P(x) = (x — 1)(# — 2)(x — 3)
Note: To resolve into factor of the polynomial P(x) first we determine the factor
of type (x — r) and then divide directly P(x) by (« — r) or rearrange the terms
of P(x) in the form P(x) = (z — r)Q(x). Where the degree of Q(z) is less than
degree of P(x) by 1. Then process by determining factors of Q(x)
Example 13. Resolve into factors: 182° + 152? — x — 2
Solution: Let, P(x) = 1823+ 152? — x — 2
Here, constant terms of P(x) is -2 and the set of its factors
F,={1, -1, 2, -2}.
The set of factors of leading co-efficient of 18 is
Fy ={1, -1, 2, -2,3, -3,6, —6, 9, —9, 18, —18}
Now consider P(a) where, a = : andré Fi, s€ Fy
if a =1 then, P(1) =18+15-1-240
if a =—1 then, P(—1) =-18+15+1-240
Ifa= > then P (-3) = 18 (-3) +15 (;) +5 -2
therefore, 2 + ; = (2 +1) ie., (2e+4+ 1), is a factor of P(z).
Now, 182° + 152? — 2 — 2 = 1823 + 9x? + 62? + 32 — 4x — 2
= 9a?(2x + 1) + 3x(2x + 1) — 2(2¢ + 1) = (2x + 1)(9x? + 3x — 2)
And 927+32—2 = 92*+6r—32—2 = 3x(382+2)—1(82+2) = (32+2)(32—1)
., P(a) = (24 + 1)(8e + 2)(8a — 1) °0
Example 14. Resolve —32? — 2zy + 8y* + 112 — 8y — 6 into factors. 8

Chapter 2. Algebraic Expression 51
Solution: Considering only the terms of z and constant, we get —32? + llz —
6
—82? + 11x — 6 = (—32z + 2)(z — 3) or (82 — 2)(—2 + 8)------ (1)
Again only considering terms of y and constant, we get 8y? — 8y — 6
8y? — 8y — 6 = (4y + 2)(2y — 3) or (—4y — 2)(—2y + 3) ------ (2)
combining factors of above (1) and (2) factors of the given polynomial can be
found, but the constants +2,—3 or —2,+3 must be same in both equations just
like the coefficients of x and y.
.. factors are (—3x + 4y + 2)(x + 2y — 3) or (3a — 4y — 2)(—x — 2y +4 3).
To verify the factors we can check the co-efficient of zy -3 -2+4-1=—-2or

Homogeneous, Symmetric and Cyclic Expressions
Homogeneous Polynomial: If each term of a polynomial has the same degree,
it is called homogeneous polynomial. The expression x? + 2zy + 5y? is a
homogeneous polynomial of the variable z, y with two degree (each term having
degree 2).
It is a special case of the homogeneous polynomial az?+2hry+by” of degree two in
two variables z, y where, a, h, b are definite numbers. Considering x, y, a, h, b
the variables,az? + 2hay + by? is homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. 2z?y +
y?z +9272 — 5zryz is a homogeneous polynomial of the variables z, y, z each term
having degree 3.
(Symmetric Expression): An expression with more than one variable, which
remains unchanged when any two of its variables are interchanged is called
symmetric expression.
The expression a + b+ c is symmetric expression of the variables, a, b, c because
the expression remains unchanged when any two of the variables are
interchanged.Similarly, ab + bc + ca of the variables a, b, c and
a+ y* + 2274+ 2y + yz + zx are symmetric expression of the variables
TY, %
But 2z?+52y+6y? is not a symmetric expression of the variables 7 and y Because
interchanging x and y it becomes 2y? + 5ry + 6x? which is different from former
expression.
(Cyclic Expression): An expression with three variables, which remain
unchanged when the first variable is replaced by the second, the second variable
is replaced by the third and the third variable is replaced by the first variable is
called (cyclically symmetric expression). If the replacing of the variables is
done cycle-wise like the adjacent figure, it is called cyclically symmetric FS
expression. N

Chapter 2. Algebraic Expression 53
C J
Le J
a +y*+2%-+2y + yz + 22 is a cyclic expression of the variables x, y, z because
replacing x by y, y by z and z by z the expression remains the same.Similarly
the expression x*y + y?z + z?z is a cyclic expression of variable z, y, z.
The expression 2? — y? + z? is not cyclic because replacing x by y, y by z and
z by x the expression becomes y? — z? + 2? which is different from the former
expression.
Clearly, every symmetric expression in three variables is cyclic. But not every
cyclic expression is symmetric. For example, the expression, z?(y — z) + y?(z -—
x) + 27(x — y) is cyclic, not symmetric. For interchanging z and y it becomes
y?(e—z)+27(z—y)+27(y—z), which is different from the former expression.
Observation: For convenience of description, the expression of variable z, y is
denoted by F(z,y) and that of variable z, y, z is denoted by F(z, y, z)
Work: Show that, 7 aa z + : is cyclic but not symmetric.

Resolve into factors of cyclic polynomials
There is no hard and fast rule for factorizing polynomials. Often a factor can
be found by suitable rearranging the terms. Sometimes assuming the expression
as polynomial of the variable, we determine one or more than one factors by
the factor theorem and considering the cyclic and symmetric properties of the
expression, we determine the remaining factors.
In this regard, it may be noted that, of the variable, a, b, c

x 1) If (a— 6) be the factor of a cyclic polynomial then, (6 — c) and (c — a) will

N be factor of that polynomial.

54 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
2) k(at+b+c) and
k(a? +b? +c”) + m(ab+ be+ ca) are the homogeneous and cyclic polynomial
of degree 1 and 2 where & and m constant.
3) Ifthe values of two polynomials are equal for all values of the variables, the
coefficient of the corresponding two terms of the polynomial will be equal.
Example 15. Resolve into factors bc(b — c) + ca(c — a) + ab(a — 6)
Solution: Here two methods are shown.
First Method: bc(b — c) + ca(c — a) + ab(a — 6)
= be(b — c) + 7a — ca? + 07b — ab?
= be(b— c) + a*b — ca? — ab? + ca
= be(b—c) + a?(b—c) — a(b? — c’)
= be(b — c) +. a?(b—c) — a(b+ c)(b—c)
= (b—c){bc + a? — a(b+ 0)}
= (b—c){be + a? — ab — ac}
= (b—c){be — ab — ac + a*}
= (b—¢){b(e— a) — a(e—a)}
= (b-—c)(c—a)(b—a)
= —(a—b)(b—c)(c—a)
Second method: Considering the given expression as a polynomial P(a) in a, we
substitute b for a,
P(b) = bce(b — c) + cb(c — b) + 67(b — b) =0
So (a — 6) is a factor of given expression. Similarly (b — c) and (c — a) are
factors of given expression.
The product of these three factors is a cyclic homogeneous polynomial of
degree 3, as is the given expression. So, any remaining factor must be a
constant.
ice., bc(b — ce) + ca(c — a) + ab(a — 6) = k(a — b)(b—c)(c—a)------ (1)
where k is a constant (1) is true for all values of a, b, c
Putting a=0, b=1, c=2 in (1),
1-2(-1) = k(-1)(-1)(2) os. R= 1
.. be(b — c) + ca(c — a) + ab(a — b) = —(a — b)(b—€)(c — a) °
Example 16. Resolve into factor a3(b — c) + b?(c — a) + (a — b). 8

Chapter 2. Algebraic Expression 55
Solution: Considering given expression a polynomial P(a) in a, we substitute
b for a, P(b) = b°(b — c) + B(e — 6) + 3(b— b) = 0. So (a — dD) is a factor of
given expression. As it is a cyclic polynomial (b—c) and (¢— a) also the factor of
given expression. While the given expression is a cyclic homogeneous polynomial
of degree 4 and (a — 6)(b — c)(c — a) cyclic homogeneous polynomial of degree
3. So the remaining factor must be a cyclic homogeneous polynomial of degree 1
k(a+b-+c), where k is a constant.
-. 2(b—c)+03(c—a)+c3(a—b) = k(a—b)(b—c)(c—a)(at+bt+e)------ (1)
For all values of a, 6, c (1) is true.
So in (1) putting a=0, b=1, c=2,
2+8(—-1) = k(—1)(-1)(2)(3) or k=—1
In (1) putting k = —1,
a3(b—c) + B(c—a)+c(a— b) = —(a— b)(b—c)(c—a)(a+b+c)
Example 17. Factorize (b + c)(c + a)(a+ b) + abc
Solution: Considering the expression P(a) in a substituting —b —c for a,
P(—b-c) = (b+c)(c—b—c)(—b—c+b)+(—b—c)be = be(b+c) —be(b+c) =0
so (a+6+c) is a factor of the expression. The given expression having a cyclic
homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 and one factor of degree 1 have been found.
So, the remaining factor will be cyclic homogeneous polynomial of degree two, i.e.,
will be of the form k(a? +b? +c?) +m(bc+ca+ab) where k and m constant.
~. (b+e)(c+a)(a+b)+abe = (a+b+c){k(a?+b?+c?)+m(be+catab)}--- (1)
(1) is true for all value of a, b,c.
Putting in (1) first a = 0,6 = 0,c = 1 and then a = 1, b= 1, c = 0, we get
respectively,
0=k and x24+m) -k=0,m=1
Now, putting the value of k and m, (b+ c)(c+ a)(a+ b) + abe = (a+b + c)(be+
ca + ab)
By using the similar method of solving Example 15, the expression described in
« Example 16 and Example 17 can be factorized.

An Important Algebraic Formula: For all values of a, b, c,
a? + B8 + ¢3 — 3abe = (a+b +0¢)(a? + B? + c? — ab— be — ca)
Proof: Two proofs of the formula are given below.
First method (Direct applying algebraic method)
a + 8 +c} — 3abe
= (a + b)® — 3ab(a + b) +c? — 3abe
= (a+b)? +3 — 3ab(at+b+c)
=(a+b+c){(a+b)? — (a+ b)c + c*} — 3ab(a + b+)
=(a+b+c)(a? + 2ab+ & — ac — be +c”) — 3ab(a +b +6)
=(a+b+c)(a? +b +c? — ab—be-ca)
Second method (using properties of homogeneous cyclic expressions)
Considering the expression a® + b° +c? — 3abc a polynomial P(a) of variable
a and putting in it, a= —(b+ c) we get,
P{-(b+c)} =-(6+0)3+ +c +3(b4+ cbc = (b+ c)8 — (b+ 0)? =0
Therefore, a+ 6+ c is a factor of the expression under consideration. As
a® + & + 8 — 8abe is a cyclic homogeneous cyclic polynomial of degree 3,
the other factor will have the form k(a? + 6? + c?) + m(ab + bc + ca) where
k and m constant. Therefore, for all values of a, b and c
a® + 6? +. c3 — 3abe = (a+b 4+ 0){k(a? + b? + c*) + m(ab + bc + ca)}
Here first putting a= 1, b=0, c=0 and thena=1, b=1, c=0 we get,
k=land2=2(kx2+m)ie,k=landl1=2+m = m=-1
 @ +3 + — 3abe = (at+b+c)(a? +8 +c? — ab— be - ca)

Partial Fractions
If a given fraction is expressed as a sum of two or more fractions, then each of
the latter fractions is said to be a partial fraction of the given fraction.

Here the given expression is expressed as the sum of the two expressions i.e., the
fraction has been divided into two partial fraction.
If both N(x) and D(z) are the polynomials of the variable x and if the degree
of numerator N(z) is less than the denominator D(z) then, the fraction is called
(proper fraction). The degree of numerator N(x) is greater than or equal to that
of the denominator D(z) the fraction is called (improper fraction). For example,

the improper fraction in general rule or the terms of the numerator rearranged in
a convenient way, the fraction as a polynomial (quotient) and as the sum of the

How to convert the proper rational fraction into the partial fraction in different
ways is shown below.

1) The denominator is, or can be expressed as a product of distinct linear
factors but no factor is repeated.

2) When the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to that of the
denominator, then degree of numerator is lessen by dividing numerator by
denominator.

3) The denominator is, or can be expressed as a product of linear factors, some
of which are repeated.

Chapter 3
Geometry
In the Geometry section of the Mathematics book of class 8 and class 9-10, the
theorem of Pythagoras and its converse have been discussed in detail. In learning
mathematics, the subjects related to this play a very important role. So, in the
light of the theorem of Pythagoras, more discussion is necessary in Secondary
Higher Mathematics. For this discussion, one needs to have a clear conception
of orthogonal projection. With this objective in mind, a brief discussion of the
theorem of Pythagoras is discussed in the first part of this stage, while at the
second stage the conception of orthogonal projection and the corollary of the
Pythagoras theorem will be discussed. In the concluding part of the discussion,
some problems will be included for logical discussion and proof on the basis of
theorem of Pythagoras and its extended conception.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —

» Explain the conception of orthogonal projection.

» Prove and apply the theorems on the basis of the theorem of Pythagoras.

p> Prove and apply the theorems of the circumcentre, centroid and orthocenter.

Review of the Theorem of Pythagoras
About 600 years before the birth of the Christ, the renowned Greek scholar
Pythagoras (570-495 BC) described an extremely important theorem about
right angled triangles. This theorem was named after him and so known as the
theorem of Pythagoras. But it was known even around 1000 years before
Pythagoras. Egyptian surveyors had possessed the knowledge about the FS
theorem. The theorem of Pythagoras can be proved in many ways. Two of its %

Chapter 3. Geometry 69
proofs have been taught in lower secondary level. So we will skip its proof.
Herein it will contain only its explanation and some brief discussion.
Theorem 1 (Theorem of Pythagoras). In a right angled triangle the area of
the square drawn on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the two
squares drawn on the other two sides.

In the figure above ABC is a right angled triangle. ZBAC is a right angle and
BC is hypotenuse. If any square is drawn on the hypotenuse BC, its area is equal
to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the sides adjacent to the right
angle which are AB and AC.
Here BC? = the area of the square BB’C"C' = a?, AB? = the area of the square
AA'B"B = c?, and CA? = the area of the square CC’ A" A = 0°.
Therefore, BC? = AB? + AC? or a? = b? +c’.
For example, if the lengths of the two sides adjacent to the right angle of a right
angled triangle are b = 8 cm. and c=6 cm. it can be said as per the theorem of
Pythagoras that the length of the hypotenuse will be a = 10 cm.
Similarly, it is possible to know the length of the third side by the lengths of any
two sides.
Theorem 2 (Converse of the Theorem of Pythagoras). If the area of the square
g on one side of a triangle is equal to the sum of areas of the squares drawn on the
‘other two sides, the angle included by the latter two sides is a right angle.

Cc b A
In the figure shown above, three sides of the AABC are AB, BC and AC. The
area of the square drawn on the side BC is equal to the sum of the area of the
squares drawn on sides AB and AC. Therefore, BC? = AB?+.AC? or, a? = b?+c?.
So, ZBAC is a right angle. For example, we can say that if the lengths AB, BC
and CA of AABC are 6 cm., 10 cm. and 8 cm. respectively, ZBAC must be a
right angle.
Since, AB? = 6? square cm. = 36 square cm.,
BC? = 10? square cm. = 100 square cm.,
AC? = 8* square cm. = 64 square cm.,
.. BC? = 100 = 36+ 64 = AB? + AC?
.. ZBAC = 90° = right angle.
Orthogonal Projection of a Point: We call the orthogonal projection of any
point on any definite straight line when it signifies the foot of the perpendicular
drawn from that point on the definite straight line. Suppose, XY is a definite
straight line and P is any point (figure below). We draw the perpendicular PP’
from the point P on the straight line XY and P’ is the foot of this perpendicular.
So, the point P’ is the orthogonal of P on the line XY. The orthogonal projection
of any point on any definite straight line is a point.

Orthogonal Projection of a Line: Let, the end points of the line segment eS

Chapter 3. Geometry 71
from the points A and B respectively on the line XY. The end points of the
perpendiculars AA’ and BB’ are A’ and B’ respectively. This line segment A’B’
is the orthogonal projection of the line segmentAB on XY. Therefore, it is seen
that the orthogonal projection is determined by drawing a perpendicular. So, it
is said that the line segment A’B’ is the orthogonal projection of the line segment
AB on XY. In the figure above, if the line segment AB is parallel to XY,
then AB = A'B’. From this conception, we can say that the perpendicular of
the orthogonal projection on any line is a point. In that case, the length of the
orthogonal projection is zero.
Note:
1. The foot of the perpendicular drawn from any point on any line is the
orthogonal projection of that point.
2. The perpendicular of the orthogonal projection on any line is a point, whose
length is zero.
3. Any definite line parallel to the line segment of the orthogonal projection
will be equal to that line segment.
Some Important Theorems
We shall now present the logical proof of some important theorems on the basis
of the theorem of Pythagoras and by the conception of the orthogonal
projection.
Theorem 3. The area of the square drawn on the opposite side of the obtuse
angle of an obtuse angled triangle is equal to the total sum of the two squares
drawn on the other two sides and product of twice the area of the rectangle
included by anyone of the two other sides and the orthogonal projection of the
other side on that side.
Special Nomination: Suppose, in the triangle ABC, 7BCA is an obtuse angle,
AB is the opposite side of the obtuse angle and the sides adjacent to obtuse angle
are BC and AC respectively.
S CD is the orthogonal projection of the side AC’ on the extended side BC (figure
“ below). It is to be proved that, AB? = AC? + BC? +2-BC-CD

72 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
VA |
B C D
Proof: As CD is the orthogonal projection of the side AC’ on the extended side
BC, AABD is a right angled triangle and ZADB is a right angle.
So, according to the theorem of Pythagoras
AB? = AD? + BD?
= AD? + (BC+CDY [. BD =BC+CD|
= AD’ + BC? +CD?+2-BC-CD

. AB? = AD? + CD? + BC? +2-BC-CD.----++(1)
Again A is a right angled triangle and ZADC is right angle.

AC? = AD? + CD?....++(2)
From the equation (2), putting the value AD? + CD? = AC? in equation (1), we
get,

AB? = AC? + BC? +2-BC-CD [Proved]
Theorem 4. In any triangle, the area of the square drawn on the opposite side
of an acute angle is equal to the squares drawn on the other two sides diminished
by twice the area of the rectangle included by any one of the other sides and the
orthogonal projection of the other side on that side.
Special Nomination: In the triangle AABC, ZACB is an acute angle and the
opposite side of the acute angle is AB. The other two sides are AC and BC.
Suppose, AD is a perpendicular on the side BC (left sided figure below) and

projection of the side AC on the side BC in the case of both triangles. It is to be
proved that AB? = AC? + BC? —2-BC-CD.

Proof: AADB is a right angled triangle and ZADB is right angle.

sere (1)
In the left sided figure above BD = BC — CD.
.. BD* = (BC — CD)? = BC? + CD? —-2-BC-CD
In the right sided figure above BD = CD — BC.
.. BD? = (CD — BC)? = CD? + BC? -2-CD-BC
Therefore, in both figures, BD? = BC? + CD? —-2-BC-CD..---: (2)
Now from equation (1) and (2) we get,
AB? = AD* + BC? + CD? —2-BC-CD
Or, AB? = AD? + CD? + BC? —2.BC-CD ------(3)
Again, AADC is a right angled triangle and ZADC is a right angle.
.. According to the theorem of Pythagoras AC? = AD?+CD?..----(4)
from equation (3) and (4) we get,
AB? = AC? + BC? —2-BC-CD [Proved]
Remark:

1. In the case of the right angled triangle, the sides adjacent to the right angle
are mutually perpendiculars, so each of their orthogonal projection is zero.
If ZACB is a right angle then the orthogonal projection of AC on BC is
CD =0. So BC-CD =0, therefore AB? = AC? + BC?

2. Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, are based on Theorem 1. That is why Theorem 3
and Theorem 4 are called extensions of Theorem 1 therefore can be called
extensions of the theorem of Pythagoras.

The decisions made on the basis of the explanation above: in the case of
AABC,

1) If ZACB is an obtuse angle, AB? > AC? + BC? [Theorem 3]

2) If ZACB is a right angle, AB? = AC? + BC? [Theorem 1]

3) If ZACB is an acute angle, AB? < AC? + BC? [Theorem 4]
The following theorem is known as the theorem of Apollonius as this theorem was
stated by Apollonius(240- 190 AD). It is established on the basis of the extensions
of the theorem of Pythagoras which are Theorem 3 and Theorem 4.
Theorem 5 (Theorem of Apollonius). The sum of the areas of the squares
drawn on any two sides of a triangle is equal to twice the sum of area of the
squares drawn on the median of the third side and on either half of that side.
Special Nomination: AD, Median of triangle AABC, bisects the side BC. It
is to be proved that, AB? + AC? = 2(AD? + BD).

Proof: We draw a perpendicular AE on the side BC (left sided figure above) and
on the extended side of BC (right sided figure above). In both figures ZADB is
obtuse angle of AABD and DE is the orthogonal projection of the line AD on
the extended BD.
As per the extension of the theorem of Pythagoras in the case of the obtuse angle
[Theorem 3] we get,
AB? = AD? + BD? +2-BD-DE.------(1)

Here, ZADC is an acute angle of AAC'D and DC (left sided figure above) and
DE is the orthogonal projection of the line AD on extended DC (right sided
figure above).
As per the extension of the theorem of Pythagoras in the case of the acute angle Sy
[Theorem 4] we get, N

Determination of the relation between the side of the triangle and the

Theorems about Circles and Triangles
In this section some important theorems about circles and triangles will be
presented logically. It is mandatory for the students to know about the
similarity of two triangles before proving the theorems. Similarity of triangles is
discussed thoroughly in Secondary Geometry. For the convenience of the
students, we will briefly recapitulate the similarity of triangles.
Equiangularity: Two polygons having the same number of sides with successive
equal angles are said to be equiangular polygons.
Similarity: Two polygons having the same number of sides are said to be similar
if one can establish a one-one correspondence among their vertices such that
1) The corresponding angles are equal and
2) The corresponding sides are proportional.
In this case the two polygons are called similar polygons.

A 22 D E x A K x N
If you take a look at the figure above, you will see that,
1) The rectangular ABCD and square EFGH are equiangular but not similar.
g All of their corresponding angles are right angle, but their corresponding
N sides are not proportional.

78 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
2) The square EFGH and rhombus KLMN are not similar, since their
corresponding sides are proportional because of any successive matching of
their vertex but their corresponding angles are not equal.
However, it is not the same in the the case of two triangles. If one condition of the
mentioned two regarding the matching of the angles of the vertices of two triangles
is true, the other one will be true as well and the two triangles will become similar.
It should be mentioned in this regard that,

1) If two triangles are equiangular, each pair of equal angles are called
corresponding angles and the sides opposite to the corresponding angles
are called corresponding sides.

2) If the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the sides of another
triangle, each pair of proportional sides are called corresponding sides,
and the angles opposite the corresponding sides are called corresponding
angles.

3) In both cases the triangles are described by matching a one-one
correspondence among their vertices of the angles. For example, the
corresponding angles are ZA and ZD, ZB and ZE, ZC and ZF; the
corresponding sides are AB and DE, AC and DF, BC and EF, in case of
AABC and ADEF.

Some theorems about the similarity of the two triangle are briefly described
below.

proportional.

That is, the corresponding sides will be proportional.
Corollary 1. if two triangles are equiangular, they will be similar.
Remarks: If the two angles of one triangle are equal to the two angles of the
other, the two triangles are equiangular, hence similar. This is because, the sum
of the three angles of any triangle is two right angles.
Theorem 7. If the sides of the two triangles are proportional, the opposite
angles of the corresponding sides are mutually equal.

In the figure above, AABC and ADEF are such that their corresponding sides are

ZA=ZD,/2B=ZE and ZC = ZF.
Theorem 6 is called the converse proposition of the theorem Theorem 7.
Theorem 8. If one angle of one triangle is equal to an angle of another triangle
and the side adjoining the equal angles are proportional, the two triangles will be
similar.
In the figure below, AABC and ADEF are such that ZA = ZD and the sides a ;

The Circumcenter, Centroid and Orthocenter of a Triangle
Here it should be mentioned that, the distance between the orthocenter and a
vertex of a triangle is twice the perpendicular distance from the circumcenter to
the opposite side of that vertex.
Circumcenter of a Triangle: The circumcenter of a triangle is the point
of intersection of two perpendicular bisectors of that triangle. Noted that, the
perpendicular bisector of the third side of the triangle would pass through the
circumcenter too.
Centroid of a Triangle: The centroid of a triangle is the point of intersection eS
of three medians of that triangle. The centroid of a triangle divides cach median “%

Chapter 3. Geometry 81
into the ratio 2:1.
Orthocenter of a Triangle: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point of
intersection of the perpendiculars drawn from each vertex to their respective
opposite side.
Theorem 10. The circumcenter, the centroid and the orthocenter of any
triangle are collinear.
Special Nomination: Suppose, O is the orthocenter, S is the circumcenter and
AP is a median of the triangle AABC. The line between orthocenter O and the
circumcenter S intersect the median AP at point G. If we join S and P, the line
SP is a perpendicular on BC. So, it is enough to prove that the point G is the
centroid of AABC.

Proof: OA is the distance between the vertex A from the orthocentre O and SP is
the distance between the opposite side BC of the vertex A from the circumcentre
S of AABC. ..OA=2S5P.------(1)
Now since AD and SP both are perpendiculars on BC so AD || SP. Now
AD || SP and AP is their intersecting line. So ZPAD = ZAPS, as they are both
alternate angles. Therefore, ZOAG = ZSPG.
Now in between AAGO and APGS,

ZAGO = ZPGS [Vertical opposite angle]

ZOAG = ZSPG [Alternate angles]

.. remaining ZAOG = remaining ZPSG

Note:

1) Nine Point Circle: The total nine points including the middle points of
three sides, feet of the three perpendiculars drawn from each vertex to the
opposite side and the middle points of the three line segments joining the
orthocenter to the vertices of any triangle lie on one circle. This circle is
called the nine point circle.

2) The center of the nine point circle is the middle point of the line segment
joining the orthocenter and the circumcentre.

3) The radius of the nine point circle is half of the circumradius of the triangle.
Theorem 11 (The Theorem of Brahmagupta). If any cyclic quadrilateral has
perpendicular diagonals, then the perpendicular to a side from the point of
intersection of the diagonals always bisects the opposite side.

Special Nomination: ABCD is a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with
perpendicular diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point M. ME is a
perpendicular on the side BC from the point M and extended EM intersects
the opposite side AD at point F. It is to be proved that AF = FD.

Proof: Because they are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc C’D of the

So, ZMAF = ZFMA

Therefore, in AAPM, AF = FM
Similarly it can be shown that, 2FDM = ZBCM = ZBME = ZDMF

So, in ADFM, FD = FM

So, AF = FD [Proved]

Special Nomination: Suppose ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral whose two pairs

to be proved that, AC- BD = AB-CD+ BC-AD.
Proof: Without loss of generality we can assume that ZBAC is smaller than
ZDAC. Then we draw ZDAP at point A with line segment AD, making it equal
to ZBAC so that AP intersects the diagonal BD at point P.
According to the construction, ZBAC = ZDAP.
Adding ZC'AP in both sides, we get

Step 2. Join P, A and construct its perpendicular bisector QR.
Step 3. The lines QR and AC intersect at O.
Step 4. Taking O as centre draw the circle APS with radius OA. Then APS is
the required circle.
Proof: Join O, P. The point O lies on QR that is perpendicular bisector of
AP.
“.OA = OP.
.. The circle with centre O and radius OA passes through the points P.
Again, OA passing through A is a perpendicular to the line AB.
.. So the circle touches the line AB at the point A.
.. Taking O as centre and OA as radius, the drawn circle is required circle.
Analysis: Since the circle is required to touch a definite line at a definite point,
so that line has to be tangent to the circle at that definite point and this tangent
has to be the diameter of the circle. Since the definite point on the line and the S
definite external point both are required to lie on the circle, the perpendicular “

Equation
Equations are used to describe various mathematical problems. For example,
someone buys some shirts at the price of Tk. 200 each and some pants at Tk.
400 each, which costs him a total of Tk. 1500. We can describe this information
by the equation 200s + 400p = 1500 or, 2s + 4p = 15, where s = number of shirts
and p = number of pants.
2s + 4p = 15 is an equation, where s and p are unknown variables. Variables s
and p have specific domains and equations are used to find the values of unknown
variables from their corresponding domains.

Quadratic equations of one variable and their
solutions
We know, values of variables for which both sides of an equation are equal, are eS
called roots of that equation and these values satisfy the equation. N

Chapter 5. Equation 105
Linear and quadratic equations of one variable and linear equations of two
variables have been discussed in details in Secondary Algebra Book. A quadratic
equation of one variable e.g, ax? + bx + c¢ = 0 can be solved easily after
factorizing the left hand side of the equation if the roots are rational. But all
expressions cannot be factorized easily. That is why the following procedure is
used to solve the quadratic equations of any form.
Now we solve the 2nd quadratic equation.

In equation (1) above, 6? — 4ac is called the Discriminant of the quadratic
equation, because it determines the state and nature of the roots of the
equation.
Variations and nature of the roots of a quadratic equation depending
on the conditions of the discriminant
Let a, b, c are rational number. Then,
1) If b? — 4ac > 0 and is a perfect square, then the two roots of the equation
are real, unequal and rational.

2) Ifb?—4ac > 0 but is not a perfect square, then the two roots of the equation
are real, unequal and irrational.
3) If b? — 4ac = 0 hence the roots of the equation are real and equal. In this
b
case, t= —>-
4) If? — 4ac < 0 then the roots of the equation are not real. In this case, the
two roots are always conjugate complex or imaginary to each other.
Example 1. Solve x? —5r+6=0.

Equations involving radicals
In an equation, the quantities with a variable involving a square root sign are freed
from the square root sign by squaring and a new equation is obtained. All the
roots of the equation thus obtained do not satisfy the given equation. These are
extraneous roots. Therefore, the roots of the equation involving the radical sign
are to be tested to know whether they satisfy the given equation or not. After
test, those who satisfy the given equation are the roots of the equation. Some

System of quadratic equations with two
variables
The method of solution of the system of two linear equations with two variables or
the system of two equations of which one is linear and the other is quadratic with
two variables have been discussed in the Secondary Algebra Book. Here we will
discuss the solution methodology of some systems involving two such quadratic
equations. It may be mentioned that if x and y are two variables of any system,
then (xz, y) = (a, 5) is a solution of this system when both sides of the two
equations will be equal if we substitute a for x and 6 for y.

other symbols. Then consistent and independent equations are formed according
to the conditions of the problem. The values of the unknown quantities x and y
are obtained by solving these equations.
Example 24. The sum of the areas of the two square regions is 650 square
metres. If the area of the rectangular region formed by the two sides of the two
squares is 323 square metres, what are the lengths of the sides of the two squares?
Solution: Suppose, the length of the side of one square is x metres and that of
the other square is y metres.
According to the question, x? + y? = 650 --- (1)
and, xy = 323 --- (2)
o(a+y) =x? + y? + Izy = 650 + 646 = 1296
ie. (c+ y) = +V1296 = +36
and, (x — y)? = 2? + y? — 2xy = 650 — 646 = 4
ie. (ec -—y) = +2
Since the length is positive, the value of x + y must be positive.
..(a+y) = 36 --- (3) and (x — y) = 42 ---(4)
Adding, 2x = 36 +2

0 eet =18+1=19 or, 17

.. The length of the side of one square is 19 metres and that of the other square
is 17 meters.
Example 25. Twice the breadth of a rectangle is 10 metres more than its

of the rectangle is y metres.

22 According to the question, 2y = x + 10 --- (1)

R xy = 600 --+ (2)

120 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
From equation (1) we get, y = a
putting the value of y in equation (2) y we get, ma = 600
or, Meta = 600 or, x? + 102 = 1200
or, 2? + 102 — 1200 = 0 or, (x + 40)(x — 30) =0
Therefore, x + 40 = 0 or, g — 30 =0
i.e. 2 = —40 or, c = 30
But length cannot be negative, .. z = 30
.. Hence, the length of the rectangle = 30 meter.

Inequality
We have acquired knowledge about equation and equality. But inequality also has
an important and significant role in our practical life.
At the end of this chapter, students will be able to-

>» Explain the inequality of one or two variables.

» Form and solve simple inequalities of two variables.

>» Use inequalities to solve practical mathematical problems.

» Solve inequalities of one and two variables graphically.
Concept of Inequality
Suppose, there are 200 students in a class. Obviously it will be seen that, neither
all the students are present in the class, nor all of them are absent always. If the
number of present student is x in a particular day we can write 0 < x < 200.
In a similar situation, we see that not all the invited persons become present
in a ceremony. Clear conception of inequalities is needed in making dresses and
other consumer goods. Essential materials for constructing buildings, printing
books and for many other similar works cannot be estimated exactly. So, initially
we have to buy or collect those essential materials on the basis of judgment.
Therefore, it is understood that the knowledge of inequalities is very essential in
our everyday life.
In case of real numbers,
a > b if and only if (a — 6) is positive therefore (a — 6) > 0
a <b if and only if (a — 6) negative therefore (a — b) < 0

2) «—2<0 [Subtracting 2 in both sides]
3) 2% < 4 [Multiplying both sides by 2]

Nota Bene: Just like how the solution of an equation is expressed by an equation
(equality), the solution of an inequality are usually expressed by an inequality.
The solution set of an inequality is usually an infinite subset of the set of real
numbers.

Linear Inequality with Two Variables

We have learned to draw the graph of the linear equations with two variables of

the form y = mz +c (whose general form is az + by + c = 0) (in class 8 and class

9-10). We have seen that the graph of each equation of this type is a straight line.

In XY plane, co-ordinates of any point on the graph of equation az + by+c=0

satisfies the equation. That means the left hand side of the equation will be zero

if we replace the x and y with the abscissa and ordinate respectively of that point.

On the other hand, the co-ordinates of any point outside the graph does not satisfy

the equation, in other words for abscissa and ordinate of that point the value of

ax +by+c is greater or less than zero. When z and y of the expression ax + by+c

are replaced respectively by the abscissa and ordinate of any point P on the plane,

the value of the expression is called the value of expression at the point P and

that value is generally denoted by f(P). If P is on the graph, f(P) = 0, if point iS

lies outside the graph then f(P) > 0 or f(P) <0. s

Chapter 6. Inequality 139
As a matter of fact, in reality all points outside the graph is divided into two
half-planes by the graph. For each point P of one half plane, f(P) > 0; for each
point P of other half plane, f(P) < 0. In fact, for each point P on the graph,
f(P) =0.

This graph-line divides the plane into three parts. These are:
1. Points on the side marked (a) of the line
2. Points on the side marked (b) of the line and
3. Points which lie on the line
Here the side marked (a) may be called the upper part of the graph-line and the
side marked (b) may be called the lower part of the graph-line.
1. Three points (3,3), (4,1), (6,—1) are taken on the side marked [(a)]. The
values of «+y—3 in these points are 3, 2,2 respectively, who are all positive.
2. Three points (0,0), (1,1), (—1,—1) are taken on the side marked [(b)]. The
values of x + y — 3 in these points are —3, —1, —5 respectively, who are all
negative.
Nota Bene: We can determine which side is positive and which side is negative
8 of az + by +c = 0, by taking a point on the one side of the graph of the line and
\ then determining the value of az + by + c at that point.

To draw the graph of the inequality 2 + y — 3 > 0, if we put the origin (0,0) in
that equality, we get —3 > 0 which is not true. So the graph of the inequality will
be on the side of the equation z + y — 3 = 0 which is opposite to the side where
the origin lies.

Example 10. Describe the solution set and draw the graph of the inequality

Qe — 3y +6 =O or, y= +2
Co-ordinates of some points on this graph-line are:

Now on the squared paper we take length of the side of a small square as unit and
then plot the points (0,2), (—3,0), (3,4). Next we draw the graph of the equation

Now at the origin (0,0), the value of the expression 2x — 3y + 6 is 6, which is
positive. Thus we have 2x — 3y + 6 > 0 for all points on the origin side of the
graph-line.
3 So, the solution set of the inequality 22 — 3y + 6 > 0 consists of the co-ordinates
“of all points on the graph line of the equation 22 — 3y+6 = 0 and the co-ordinates

The graph of this solution set is the shaded region of the above figure in which
the graph-line is also included.

The origin lies at the night side of the graph-line and at origin z = 0 which reduces
the inequality to > -9 which is true.
Therefore, the co-ordinates of all points on the right side of the graph-line are
the solutions of the given inequality (points on the graph-line is not considered).
The graph of the inequality is the shaded region of the above figure(this does not
consist of the graph-line).
Example 12. Draw the graph of the inequality y < 22.
Solution: We can write the inequality y < 2z in the form of y — 2x < 0.
Now we draw the graph of the equation y — 2x = 0 or y = 2a. From the equation
we get,

In the graph paper, taking the length of the side of a small square as unit, we plot eS

Infinite Series
Sequence and finite series are discussed in detail in the General Mathematics Book
of Class IX-X. There is a direct relationship between sequence and infinite series.
Infinite series can be obtained after assigning plus signs before the terms of a
sequence. Infinite series will be discussed in this chapter.
After completing the chapter, the students will be able to —
» explain the idea of a sequence
> identify the infinite series
> explain the condition of existing the sum of an infinite geometric series
> sum an infinite series geometric series
» transform a recurring decimal number into an infinite geometric series and
express in fraction.
Sequences
In the relationships illustrated below, every natural number n is related to its
square n”; that is, the set of square numbers {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} is obtained for the set
of natural numbers N = {1,2,3,4,...} under a certain rule. This set of arranged
sequence numbers is a sequence. When some numbers are arranged successively
under a definite rule such that the relationship between any two successive terms
is known, then the set of numbers arranged in this way is called a sequence.
1 2 3 4 tee n wae
4 L 1 + 1
1 4 9 16 wae n2 ave
The relationship shown above is called a function and is written as f(n) = n?.
The general term of this sequences is n*. The number of terms of any sequence is
infinite. The way to write the sequence in terms of the general term is {n?} ,n =
% 1,2,3,4,... or, {n?} roo or just, {n?}. The first number of a sequences is called

3) Write the general term of a sequence and then write the sequence.
Series
If the terms of a sequences are connected successively by a ‘+’ sign, there a
epuig is formed. As an example, 1+4+9+16+... is a series. Then again,
3 + Z + 3 + i6 +... is another series. The ratio between two successive terms
of this series is the same. This type of series is called Geometric Series. The
characteristics of a series depends on the relationship between two consecutive
terms of it. For example, in case of Arithmetic Series, the difference between
two consecutive terms is constant.
Depending on the number of terms, series can be divided into two classes: 1)
Finite series 2) Infinite series . Finite series are discussed in the General
Mathematics Book of Class IX-X. Infinite series will be discussed here.

Infinite Series
Tf wi, ta, Us, ---,Un,--- is a sequence of real numbers, then uj+-ue+ug3t+...tun+t...
is called an infinite series of real numbers. u,, is called the n-th term of this
series.
Partial Sum of Infinite Series
Let uy +ug+ug+...+Un+... be an infinite series. Then its:
1st partial sum is S; = uw,
2nd partial sum is Sy = uz + ue
3rd partial sum is S3 = wu, + ug + u3
.. The n-th partial sum is S, = uj) + ue +ug+...+Un
That is, the n-th partial sum of an infinite series is the sum of the first n number
of terms of the series, where n € N.
Example 1. Find the partial sum of the following two series:
1) 14243444... 2) 1-14+1-1+...
Solution:
1) First term of the series a = 1 and common difference d = 1. Therefore, the
given series is an arithmetic progression.
Sum of the arithmetic series
Sn = 5 {2a+ (n— Id} =F {2-14 (n-1)-1}
SoS, =" 24+n—1) = MO
In the above equation, putting different values of n we get,
Si9 = asa = 55 Si000 = = 500500
Sio0000 = “om = 5000050000
Here as 7 increases, the value of S, becomes larger.
Therefore, the given infinite series has no sum.
2) 1-1+41-1+4... is the given infinite series. Its

150 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
In the above example it can be seen that, for odd n, the n-th partial sum
S, = 1 and for even n, the nth partial sum S, = 0.
Therefore, it is observed that there is no specific number which is the sum
of this series.
Sum of Infinite Geometric Series
atar+ar?+ar%+... is a geometric series. Its first term is a and common ratio
is r.
Therefore, the n-th term of the series = ar", where n € N
Now, if r #1 then the partial sum of this series upto n-th term is
Sn =atar+ar?+are+...+ar™1
‘an 1 1 _— rt

r-1 l-r
We observe:

1) In the case of |r| < 1, that is -1 <r <1, if the value of n increases (that is,
when 7 — oo) then the value of |r”| decreases. Thus making n sufficiently
large, the value can be decreased indefinitely, that is, |r”| approaches 0. So,
the limiting value of |r”| becomes 0.

onsequently, the limiting value of .S,, S;, —_ ae

Therefore, the sum of the infinite series S.. = =r

2) In the case of |r| > 1, that is r > 1 or r < —1, if the value of n increases
then the value of |r”| increases and making n sufficiently large the value of
|r"| can be increased indefinitely. From this it is clear that there does not
exist a finite numbers S which can be considered as the limiting value of S,.
So, in this case, sum of the infinite series does not exist.

3) Ifr = —1, then the limiting value of S, cannot be found. Because, if n is
even then (—1)" = 1 and if n is odd, then (—1)" = —1. In this case the
series will be, a—at+ta-—a+a-—a+.... co
So, sum of this infinite series does not exist. 8

Chapter 7. Infinite Series 151
4) In case of r = 1, limiting value of S,, cannot be found as well. Because, in
that case the series will bea+a+a+a+... (n numbered). That means,
Sp, = na which can be increased with the increasing of n.
So, sum of this infinite series does not exist.
If |r| < 1, that is —1 < r < 1, then the sum of the infinite series a + ar +
ar? +... S= > For other values of r, the sum of the series does not
exist.
Remark: The sum of the infinite geometric series (if exists) is sometimes denoted
by So and it is called the sum of, the series up to infinity. That is, a+ ar + ar? +
ar? +... up to infinity, S,. = Tor when |r| < 1.

Trigonometry
The word Trigonometry has been derived from the words “Trigon’ and ‘Metry’.
‘Trigon’ is a Greek word which means three angles and ‘Metry’ means measure.
In general Trigonometry means the measurement of three angle of a triangle.
For practical purposes, trigonometry was introduced from for the measurement
of three angle and three sides of a triangle and from their related ideas. For
example, the use of trigonometry in measuring the height of the tree with the
help of its shadow, determining the width of a river by standing on its bank,
determining the area of a triangular land etc. is very ancient and popular.
Besides, trigonometry is extensively used in every branches of mathematics and
science. That is why trigonometry is well established as a very important topic
in mathematics. Trigonometry has two branches; one is Plane Trigonometry,
the other is Spherical Trigonometry. We are concerned with plane
trigonometry only.

Angles in Geometry and in Trigonometry
For the convenience of discussion of angles in geometry and trigonometry, let us
draw a pair of mutually perpendicular straight lines XOX’ and YOY’ at the plane
XY In the following figure as the lines bisects at the point O, each of the regions
included between the four right-angles is called a Quadrant. By moving anti-
clockwise from the line OX, the first region enclosed by (ZX OY 1 right angle )
is called First quadrant and by moving accordingly region enclosed by second
(ZYOX"), third (ZX’OY’) and fourth (ZXOY')right angle is called second,
third and fourth quadrant(Following figure).

In geometry angle is formed by two rays meeting at a point. In trigonometry an
angle is produced by a revolving ray about a fixed ray. Let, OA is a revolving
ray and at the beginning it revolve anticlockwise from the fixed ray OX. The ray
OA at first form acute angle 7X OA, at the position OA; and remain in the first
quadrant and then when it come to the position perpendicular to OY with OX,
the measurement of 7XOY become 90° or 1 right angle. By more revolving at
the same direction when the ray OA comes to the position OA, then it forms
an obtuse angle 72XOA2. By more revolving at same direction when the ray
OA comes to the opposite of the ray OX at the position of OX’, then the angle
ZX OX’ is formed is a straight angle or 2 right angle. By complete revolving when
the ray OA comes to previous position that is merge with OX, then the angle
formed is 2 straight angle or 4 right angle.
In geometry angles are limited to 180°, and there is no difference between
Sy geometric and trigonometric angles in this case. If we consider that the ray OA
“revolves further to reach OA, after completing a round then the angle formed

160 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
XOA, becomes greater than 4 right angles. The angle 2XOX created by the
original position of the ray OA is not considered as a geometric angle, but it is
considered an angle in trigonometry.
Positive and negative angle

In the above discussion, the ray OA (above figure) has been revolved
anticlockwise and the angles formed by OA at different quadrant was considered
as positive angles. Therefore, an angle produced by anti-clockwise revolving is
considered positive and an angle produced by clockwise revolving is considered
negative.
So, from the above discussion it can be said that, when the positive angle is
less than 90° then it remains in first quadrant. Again, the angle will also be in
first quadrant if the value is between 360° and 450°. Similarly, if the value of a
positive angle is between 180° and 270° then it will remain in the trird quadrant,
if from 90° to 180° then in the second quadrant and between 270° and 360° then
it will be in fourth quadrant. Likewise, if the value of a negative angle is from
—90° to 0° then it will remain in fourth quadrant, from —180 to —90° in third
quadrant, from —270° to —180° in second quadrant and from —360° to —270° in
first quadrant. 180° and 360° or any integer multiplicand of them coincide with
the straight line XOX’ and 90° and 270° or any integer multiplicand of them
coincide with the straight line YOY’ (see the adjacent figure). ZAOAjin first
quadrant, ZAOA, in second quadrant, 7AOAsz in third quadrant and ZAOA, in
the fourth quadrant.
Example 1. In which quadrants do the angles 1) 430° and 2) 545° lie?

1) 430° = 360° + 70° = 4 x 90° + 70° 430° is a positive angle and 4 is greater
than right angle but 5 is less than right angle. Therefore, to produce the
angle 430° any ray have to rotate 4 right angle or have to revolve one full
rotation and 70° more (Follwing figure at left). So, the angle 430° lies in the 3
first quadrant. N

2) 545° = 540° + 5° = 6 x 90° + 5° 545° is a positive angle and 6 is greater
than right angle but 7 is less than right angle. To produce the angle 545°
any ray have to rotate 6 right angle and 5° in the anticlockwise direction or
two right angle and 5° after the full rotation(Above figure in left). So, the
angle 545° lies in the third quadrant.

Work: Determine in which quadrant each of the following angle lie: 330°,

535°, 777° and 1045°; draw pictures.

produce the angle —520° any ray have to rotate one right angle or 90° and
70° more in the same direction after the full rotation in clockwise direction

Measurement of Angles

To measure any angle we use two unit systems :

1) Sexagesimal System and
2) Circular System

Sexagesional System: In this system right angle is considered as unit of

measurement of angle. In this system one degree is one — ninetieth 90 part of a

right angle one metre (1° = one degree).

One-minute is one sixtieth 60 part of one degree i.e., (1 = one minute) and that

of one-second is one sixtieth 60 part of one minute i.e., (1”= one second).

That is, 60” (second) = 1’ (minute)

60’ (minute) = 1° (degree)

90° (degree)= 1 right angle

Radian system is necessary to know before circular system.

Radian: In any circle the angle which an arc of the circle whose length is equal

to the radius of the circle subtends at the centre, is called one radian.

Q
:

In figure centre of circle PQR is O, radius OP = r and PQ is an arc equal to the

radius. Arc PQ produce angle 7POQ at the centre O. This measurement of that

angle is called radian i.e. ZPOQ is a randian.

Circular System: In circular system one radian angle is considered as Sy

measurement unit of angle. to determine the relation between radian %

measurement and degree measurement the following proposition need to be
known.
Proposition 1. In any two circles the ratios of the circumferences and the
respective diameters and equal.
Proof: We can assume that the circles have the same centre O and they are
concentric. Let p and r denote the circumference and radius of the inner (smaller)
circle and P and R denote the circumference and radius of the outer (greater)
circle(following figure). We divide the circumference of the outer circle into n
equal arcs where (n > 1). Joining the dividing points with centre the inner circle
also divided into n equal parts. Let us join the dividing points of both the circles.
We get consequently (outer circle ABCD... and inner circle abcd...) two n sided
regular polygons inscribed in the outer and inner circle, respectively.
Now, AOAB and AOab are similar, because,
ZAOB and ZaOb [common angle] and being
isosceles triangles, their other two angles are equal. PP,

Remark: In any circle the circumference bears a constant ratio to its diameter.
This constant ratio is denoted by the Greek letter 7 (pi). a is an irrational
number and expressing in decimal places it will be non-terminating where, (7 =
3.1415926535897932...).
Remark: Generally approximate value of 7 upto four decimal places is used
where 7 = 3.1416. Using computer the value of 7 has determined upto millions
and millions of digit in decimal place. As we use approximate value of 7, so
answer must be approximated. That is why it is required to write ’approx’ beside
the answer. Approximate value of 7 is 3.1416 will be used as no direction is
mentioned.

proportional to its arc.

Definition 1. By circular system i.e., The measure of an angle in the radian
unit is called its radian measure or circular measure.
Suppose 7MON is a given angle. With centre O we draw a circle of suitable
radius OA = r. Suppose the circle intersects the sides OM and ON of the angle

When OA lie in first quadrant then both z and y are positive so, all trigonometric

ratios in first quadrant is positive. When OA lie in second quadrant abscissa x is

negative ordinate and y is positive. So in the 2nd quadrant sin (sing = *) and

cosec (coseoo = r) are positive and the other ratios are negative. Similarly in

3rd quadrant abscissa x and y both are negative and tan (tan = = = Y) and

cot (cov = = = *) is positive and the ratios are negative. When OA lies in

Trigonometric ratios
In class 9 and 10 the trigonometric ratio of acute angle has been discussed. Now
we shall describe the trigonometric ratio of any angle.
Standard Position of angle: In the main point O of Cartesian plane if an
angle is drawn considering x-axis as original ray then standard position of angle
can be obtained.
Definition of ratios

Therefore, in case of acute angle the definition of trigonometric ratio based on

Trigonometric ratios of many angles
We discussed the technique about determining the ratios of an acute angle
(0 <4< ) in the second part of trigonometry. Some easy identities are
proved concerning relations of ratios. Sign of ratios in different quadrants,
trigonometrical ratios of standard angles, idea of maximum and minimum values
of ratios are conceptualized. Now we determine the ratios of negative angle %
(—0). Based on them we discuss the trigonometrical ratios of the angles 37 0, 8

Method of determining the trigonometric ratios of (n x ai 6) where

0<0< 5):

Paves

Trigonometric ratios can be determined by the following steps.

Step 1. We are to. divide the given angle into two parts whose one part is n
multiple of 2 or 2 and the other part is an acute angle. ie., we are to
express the given angle in the form (n x = ae 6).

Step 2. If m is even the ratio remain the same that is sine remain sine, cosine
remain cosine etc.

20 If n is odd the ratio will be changed that is, sine, tangent and sec will be
& changed into cosine, cotangent and cosecant, cosine, cotangent.

196 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
Step 3. After knowing the position in the quadrant of (n x : te 6) we have to
put the sign of ratio determined in step 2
Nota Bene: To determine the ratios students are advised to follow the method
discussed here.
Example 22. sin é + 6) here n = 9 odd number. So the ratio of sin will be

Rational and Irrational Exponents
We recall some notations : R denotes the set of real numbers
N denotes the set of natural numbers
Z denotes the set of integers
Q denotes the set of rational numbers
If a is any real number and n is any natural number, when a is multiplied n times,
g the product is written as a” = a-a-a--- (n times) and a” is called n th power of
“a. In such cases, a is called the base and n is called the exponent or index.

206 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
.. in 34 the base is 3 and exponent is 4.
(2\" 2 ;
Again, in 3) the base is 3 and exponent is 4.
Definition: For alae R
1. a =a
2. a*=a-a-a---a (n times factor of a), wheren € Nn >1
Irrational Exponent
When an exponent z is irrational, we fix the value of a*(a > 0) so that for some
rational value p approximate to x, the value of a? is close to the value of a’.
For example, we consider the number 35, We know, V5 is an irrational number
and 5 = 2.236067977 --- (We have obtained this value using calculator and ---
indicates that the decimal expression is infinite).
As the approximate values of V5 considering
pi = 2.23 po = 2.236 ps3 = 2.2360 pa = 2.23606 ps = 2.236067
De = 2.2360679 Pr = 2.23606797
we obtain the following approximate values of 35,
qi = 373 = 11.5872505 go = 37796 = 11.6638822 gg = 3773 — 11.6638822
4 = 37-3606 — 1166465109 gs = 37796067 — 11.6647407
de = 377360679 — 116647523 gy = 3778606797 — 11.6647532
This values have also been obtained using calculator.

Explanation of the Root
Definition: Ifn € N,n > 1landae R, if there is such x € R that x” = a, then
this z is called a n-th root of a. If n = 2 this root is called square root and for
n = 3 it is called cube root.
Example 5. 1) 2 and —2 both are fourth root of 16, as (2)* = 16 and &
(—2)4 = 16 ES

Chapter 9. Exponential and Logarithmic Function 211

2) -3 is cube root of —27, since (—3)3 = —27

3) Vn €N,0 is the n-th root of 0. For n > 1, 0" =0

4) —9 has no square root, because square of any real number is non-negative.

It is important to know and remember the following facts,

(i) Ifa > 0 and n € N,n > 1, then a has a unique positive n-th root. This
unique positive root is denoted as ~/a (¥/a is replaced with ,/a) and it is
called the principal n-th root of a. If n is an even number, a has another
n-th root and that is — ~/a

(it) If a < 0 and n € N,n > 1 is odd number, then a has only one n-th root
which is negative. This root is denoted as —%/a. If n is even and a is
negative, a does not have have any n-th root.

(i) n-th root of 0 is YO =0
Note:

1. Ifa>0, Ya>0

2. ifa<Oand nis odd, Ya = — /|a| < 0 [where |a| is the absolute value of
a]

Example 6. V4 = 2,(/4 4 -2), Y-8 = -2 = -—W,
Ve = lal = a, whena>0
—a, whena<0
Formula 7. Ifa<0,n€N,n> 1 and n is odd then show that, ~/a = — 7/|a|
Proof:
Va= Y—la| [-a< 0]
= Y(-1)"\a| [2 is odd]

So, Ya = y lal
Example 7. Find the value of —W/27.

Proof: Let, Ya =z and VYa™ = y

Then, 2” = a and y” = a™

or, y= a™ = (a")™ = (a™)"

Since y > 0,2” > 0, therefore considering the unique n-th root we get, y =

Let, ?/a™ = x then, x” = a™

or, (2")* = (a™)"

or, 2! = q™4 = ah”

or, (x#)" = (a?)"

or, z? = a? [considering the unique n-th root]

Remark: Exponent Rule (a™)” = a™" [Formula 6]

If it is to be true in all cases, then (a*)" = an =a! = a needs to happen, i.e
n-th root of am needs to happen. So the definition mentioned above is explained
to prevent ambiguity for more than one number of roots. ©
Remark: Ifa < Oandn € N, n > 1 odd then from formula 7 it is seen that 8

In these cases using this formula, the value of a» is determined.
Remark: If a is a rational number, then in most of the cases a* will be a rational
number too. In these cases, the approximate value of an is used.
Definition 6: If a>0,m¢€Z andné N,n>1a% =(an)™
Note: From definition 5 and 6 and formula 8 we can see that,
an = (¥%a)” = VYa™ where, a>0,me Zand, ne N,n>1
So,p € Zand gq € Z,n > 1 if such that, ° = i; happens, then we can see from
formula 9 that, a» = aa
Note: From the definitions of integer exponents and rational fractional exponents,
we can get the explanation of a’, where a > 0 and r € Q. From the above
discussion we can see that if a > 0, then if r is divided into equal fractional value,
the value of a” does not change.

Logarithm
Logarithm originated from two Greek words Logos and arithmas. Logos means
discussion and arithmas means number. So logarithm means discussion about
numbers.
Definition: If a” = b, where a > 0 and a £1 then z is called the logarithm of b
to the base a where x = log,b
Hence, if a* = b, then x = log,b
On the other hand, if z = log,b, then a” = b
In this case the number b is the antilogarithm of x with respect to base a and we
o Write, b = antilog,¢
& In many cases the bases of log and anti log is not written.

220 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
Example 18. antilog2.82679 = 671.1042668
antilog(9.82672 — 10) = 0.671
and antilog(6.74429 — 10) = 0.000555
Note: The approximate value of loga can be determined using scientific
calculator. (Detailed explanation is given in the mathematics book of class
9-10)
According to the definition, we get,
log.64 = 6 as 2° = 64 and log,64 = 2 as 8” = 64
Therefore, logarithm of same number can be different based on different bases.
Different logarithm values of same number can be determined by taking any
number as base which is positive but not 1. Any positive number can be
regarded as a base of logarithm. Logarithm values of zero or any negative
number can not be determined.
Note: Ifa >0,a 41 and 6 £0 then logarithm of 6 with a unique base a can be
denoted by log,b.
Therefore,

1) log,6 = z if and only If a* = b. From (a) we can see that,

2) log,(a*) =a

3) aléab = b

5) 18 =log,(2"*) log, (a*) = 2]
Formulas of Logarithm
Since proofs have been already given in the mathematics book of class 9-10, here
only the formulas are shown.

1. log,a = 1 and log,1 =0 00

2. log,(M x N) = log,M + log,N 8

Chapter 9. Exponential and Logarithmic Function 221
3. log, () = log, M — log,N
4. log,(M%) = Nlog,M
5. log,M =log,M x log,b [Formula for changing the base]
Example 20. _log,5 + log,7 + log,3 = log, (5 - 7 - 3) = log,105
Example 21. 1log,20 — log,5 = logs = logs4
Example 22. _log;64 = log,2® = 6 log;2
Note:
(i) Ifx>0, y>Oanda¥1 then z = y if and only if log, = log,y
(ii) Ifa >1 and > 1 then log,z > 0
(iti) If0<a<1land0<a2 <1 then log,z >0
(iv) Ifa >1and0 <2 <1 then log,z <0

Absolute Value
In mathematics book of class 9-10 absolute value is discussed elaborately, here
only definition is given.
For any real number z is zero, positive or negative. But absolute value of x
is always zero or positive. Absolute value of x is expressed by |z| and defined
as:
zt, whenz >0
|x| =
—z, whenz <0

Binomial Expansion
In our previous classes, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square and
cube related algebraic expressions (single term, binomial and polynomial) have
been discussed. When the power of a binomial or a polynomial expression is
more than three, determining the value of such expression is labourious and time
consuming. In this chapter, the working method will be presented in case of power
being more than three. Generally, formula will be demonstrated for the power of
n, by which the value of binomial expression of non negative integer of power
will be possible to determine. But at this stage the value of n will not exceed
a definite limit (n < 8). A triangle will be introduced called Pascal’s Triangle
so that students can easily understand and use the subject matter. The power
of binomial expression may be positive or negative integer or fraction. But our
present discussion will be limited to only positive integer of power. In higher
classes detailed discussion will be included.
After completing this chapter, the students will be able to-

» describe the binomial expression

» describe the Pascal’s triangle

» describe the binomial expression for general power

> find the value of n! and "C,

» solve mathematical problem using binomial expression.
Binomial Expansion of (1+ y)”
An algebraic expression consisting of two terms is called a binomial expression.
a+b, c—y, 1+2, 1—2?, a? —& etc are binomial expressions. We first consider
a binomial expression of (1+ y). Now we multiply (1+ y) by (1+ y) successively %&
then we get (1+y)?, (1+y)%, (1+y)4, (1+,y)®, --: etc. We know, 8

Chapter 10. Binomial Expansion 237
(l+yP=(l+y)lty)=1+ayt+y
(l+y=(+y)(lt+y)? =(1+y)( + 2y+y?) = 14 3y + 3y’? +?
Similarly it is possible to determine the value of (1+ y)*, (1+ y)°,--+ etc by the
process of lengthy multiplication. But it will be lengthy and time consuming if
the powers of (1+ y) is increasing. So it will be better to find out a method to
easily determine the expansion of (1+ y)n for any powers (say n) of (1+ y). For
n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4,--- ie. for non negative values of n, our discussion is limited
in this context. Now we carefully observe the procedure.
| Valueofn| | Pascal’s Triangle Number of Terms
n=0 (l+y) = 1 1
n=1 |(l+y= l+y 2
m=2 |(1+y?= L+Qy+y 3
n=3 |(1+y= 1+ 3y 4+ 3y?+y° 4
n=4 |(1+yt= 1+ 4y + Gy? + 4y3 + y# 5
n=5 | (L+y)> =| 14+ 5y+ l0y? + l0y? + 5y* + y® 6
On the basis of the above expressions, we come to the decision of the expansion
of (1+y)".
1) In the expansion of (1+ y)" the number of term is (n +1) i.e. number of
terms is greater than power.
2) The power of y is increasing from zero to 1, 2, 3,---,n i.e. power of y is
increasing orderly up to n.
Binomial coefficient
The coefficient of different powers of y on the above expansion is called Binomial
Coefficients. 1 is considered as the coefficient of y. If we arrange the coefficients
of the above expansion,
n=0 1
n=1 1 1
n=2 1 2 1
n=3 1 3 3 1
0 n=4 1 4 6 4 1
s n=5/1 5 10 10 5 1

238 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
If we observe we can see, the coefficients formed a triangular shape. The technique
of determining the coefficients of binomial expansion was first used by Blaise
Pascal. So it is called Pascal’s Triangle. We can easily determine the coefficients
of binomial expansion by pascal’s triangle.
Use of Pascal’s Triangle
From Pascal’s Triangle, we see that 1 is in both left and right side. The middle
term of the triangle is the summation of two number just above the numbers. If
we observe the following example, we can easily understand it.
Binomial coeffecients forn =5 n= 6 will be:
n=5-> 1 5 10 10 5 1
n=67>1 6 15 20 15 6 1

o (1+y)® =14 5y + 10y? + 10y? + 5y4 + y5
v. (1+ y)® =14 6y + 15y? + 20y3 + 15y4 + 6y® + 6
(L+y)’ =14 Ty + Qly? + 35y° + 35y4 + 21y5 + 7y® + y?

Work: Find the expansion of the following (using the above expansions):

(l+y)=

(l+y)P=

(l+y)°=
If we observe carefully, we will understand that this method has a special weakness.
For example, if we are to determine the expansion of (1+ y)°, we need to know the
expansion of (1+y)*. Again it is necessary to know preceeding two coefficients just
above for any binomial coefficients. For getting relief from this position we want
to directly find out the technique for determining the binomial coefficients. From
Pascal’s Triangle we see that power of coefficient of binomial expansion depends
on power 7 and position of the term. We consider a new symbol (") where the
power n and the position of the term r are related. For example if n = 4, the
number of terms will be 5. We write the terms like this: oo
When n = 4, number of terms is 5: T;, To, 73, Ta, Ts 8

Chapter 10. Binomial Expansion 239
Coefficients of them are: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1
. 4 4 4 4 4
Using new symbol: (6) * ({) ; (3) , (3) > ( ‘)

4)  4x3x2x1 _ 1

4) 1x2x3x4

[You will understand easily from Pascal’s triangle.]

v= GG G)G) |
Le mOROROACLOM
LELORORORCAOLOD

Therefore from the triangle above we can easily say that coefficient of third term

(To41) of (1+y)* is @) and coefficient of third (7241) and fourth (7341) of (1+y)>

are ( :) and ( :) respectively. Generally, coefficients of (r + 1)th term (T,41) of

Binomial expansion of (x + y)”

form of binomial expansion ( + y)" where n is positive integer. Generally the
expansion of (z + y)” is known as bionomial theorem.

This is the general form of binomial theorem. Observe that it is similar to (1+y)”.
Here, power of x is added from n to 0. We also observe that addition of power
of x and y in every term is equal to the power of binomial expansion. Powers of
x from initial term to the last term is decreasing from n to 0 and conversely the
powers of y is increasing from 0 to n.

Coordinate Geometry
The portion of geometry where the algebraic expressions of points, straight lines
and curved lines are studied is known as the Coordinate Geometry. This portion
of geometry is also known as the Analytic Geometry. With the plotting of
points on the plane, the straight lines or the curved lines or the figures of the
geometric regions made by them such as the triangles, the quadrilaterals, the
circles etc. are expressed. The system of plotting of points on the plane was
initiated by a French mathematician named Rene Descates (known as
Descartes). The coordinate system of geometry initiated by Descartes is called
the Cartesian coordinate system after his name. The coordinate geometry and
the analytical geometry are mainly based on Cartesian coordinate system. So,
Descates is called the initiator of the analytical geometry.
In the first part of this chapter, the tricks of determining the distance between
two points will be discussed through developing the concept of the Cartesian
coordinate system among the students. In the second part, the method of
determining the area of any triangle and quadrilateral created by straight lines
will be discussed. On the other hand, in the third part, the tricks of determining
the slope of a straight line and the simplification of the joining straight line
between the two points will be explained. No figure or equation associated with
the curved line will be discussed here. In higher classes, it will be discussed
elaborately.
After completing this chapter, the students will be able to —

» Explain the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system.

> Find the distance between two points.

> Explain the concept of slope (gradient) of a straight line.

>» Find the equation of a straight line. %

>» Determine the area of a triangle using coordinate system. 8

Chapter 11. Coordinate Geometry 253
» Find areas of triangular and quadrangular regions by measuring the lengths
of the sides.
>» Construct the geometric figures of the triangles and quadrilaterals by
plotting of points.
>» Present an equation of a straight line by plotting points.
Rectangular Cartesian Coordinates
We have been acquainted with the concept of plane in previous class. The surface
of a table, the floor of a room, the surface of a book, even the paper on which
we write down, each of them is a plane. The surface of a football or the surface
of a bottle are curved planes. In this part, the tricks of determining the proper
position of any point lying on the plane will be discussed. For determining the
proper position of any definite point, it is necessary to know the distance of the
definite point from the straight line bisectors constructed on the plane. It is said
as a reason that only a point can lie at any definite distance from two straight
line bisectors.
If two such straight lines XOX’ and YOY’ are drawn that intersect each other at
a right angle on any plane, XOX’ is called the z-axis, YOY’ is called the y-axis
and the intersecting point ‘O’ is called the origin.
Y
wy eS ,
y
M
x oji—_> x <— x
y
Now, let P be any point on the plane of the two axes. From point P, on XOX‘
ie., the x-axis and on YOY’ ie., the y-axis, the perpendiculars are respectively
PM and PN. Then the distance of point P from the y-axis = NP = OM =z is
g called the abscissa of P or z-coordinate. Again, the distance of P from the z-axis
SN == MP=ON = y is called the ordinate of P or y-coordinate. The abscissa and

254 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
the Ordinate are jointly called the Coordinate. So, in the figure, the coordinate
of P means the perpendicular distance of P from the y-axis and the z-axis and
by denoting them as x and y, the coordinate of P is expressed by the symbol
P(z,y).

The coordinate index (z, y) means an ordered pair whose first element indicates
the abscissa and the second element indicates the ordinate. So, if 4 y, by (x,y)
and (y, x), two different points are meant. Therefore, the coordinate of any point
depending on two axes intersecting each other at the right angle is called the
Rectangular Cartesian Coordinates. If the point is placed at the right side of the
y-axis, the abscissa will be positive and if it is placed at the left side, the abscissa
will be negative. Again, if the point is placed above the z-axis, the ordinate will
be positive and if it is placed below, the ordinate will be negative. On the z-axis,
the ordinate will be zero and on y-axis, the abscissa will be zero.

So, the positive abscissa and the ordinate of any point will be along OX and OY
respectively or parallel to them. Similarly, the negative abscissa or the ordinate
will be along OX’ and OY’ respectively or parallel to them.

By the two axes of the Cartesian

coordinates, the plane is divided into yi

XOY, YOX', X'OY', Y'OX these

four parts. Each of them is called a os an
quadrant.

The quadrant XOY is taken as

the first and by turns the second, a oO *
the third and the fourth quadrant

remain in anticlockwise order. — i
According to the sign of the point of

the coordinate, the point lies on the Y

different quadrants.

Distance between two points

Let, P(z1,y1) and Q(x2, ya) be the two different points on a plane. From points
P and Q, perpendiculars PM and QN are drawn on x-axis. Again from point P, eS
draw perpendicular PR on QN. _

Chapter 11. Coordinate Geometry 255
Now the abscissa of point P is = OM =
az, and the ordinate of point P is =
MP=. Olen ye)
The abscissa of point Q is = ON = x Y
and the ordinate NQis = yo.
From the figure we get, Fenaed
QR=NQ-NR=NQ-MP=y-\
As per the construction, PQR is aright »
angled triangle and PQ is the hypotenuse ° Ms N x
of the triangle. So, as per the theorem of
Pythagoras,
PQ? = PR?+QR y
or, PQ = +,/PR? + QR?
or, PQ = y/(a2 — 21)? + (y2— 9)?
.. The distance of P from Q is, PQ = ./(t2 — 21)? + (yo — yi)?
As the distance is always non-negative, the negative value has been avoided.
Again, in the same rule the distance from point Q to P is,
QP = V/ (a1 — £2)? + (yi — yo)? = Vf (#2 — 21)? + (y2 — 1)?
.. PQ=QP.
The distance from point P to Q or Q to P is equal.
Therefore, PQ = ./(x2 — 21)? + (ye — y1)? = QP

Now, BD? = 100, AB? = (2/5)? = 20, AD? = (4/5)? = 80

As per the theorem of Pythagoras, ABD is a right angled triangle and ZBAD is
a right angle. So, it is proved that, ABCD is a rectangle.

Area of triangles
We know we get the region of a triangle if we connect straight lines with three
different points that are not lying on the same straight line. That region of the
triangle may be different respective of the side and the angle. In this part we
will be able to determine the area of any triangle by finding the sides of the
triangle with the help of only one formula. With the help of this same formula, by
dividing any quadrilateral into the two triangles, the determination of the area of
the region of the quadrilateral will be possible. In this case we will determine the
area using the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of the lengths of the sides) and
the length of the side. To determine the area of a triangle-shaped or angle-shaped
land, the method i.e. by the length of side, is very important. So, it is very useful
in determining the area of the land. It is said as reason, if the coordinates of the
vertices of the triangular or quadrangular land are not known or are not possible
to know but if the coordinates are known, we will be able to determine the area
more easily. In this part we shall determine the area of a triangle or a polygon by
these two methods.
Method 1: Determination of the Area Using the Length of Sides and
Perimeter
The determination of the Area: A triangle ABC has been shown in the «
adjacent figure. A(x1,y1), B(ae, ye) and C(#s, ys) are three different points and &

AB, BC and CA are the three sides of the triangle. With the help of the
formula of determining distance, it is possible to determine easily the lengths of
the sides AB, BC and CA. For example:

Taking c as the length of side mB, Keo ¥)

C= Vf (@1 — £2)? + (yi — yo)? unit

Taking a as the length of side BC, ¢ b

a = / (2 — £3)? + (yo — ys)? unit

Taking b as the length of side AC, x i Bly Yo) @ Clty Ys) x
b= f(a — £3)? + (yi — ys)? unit

y'
Now taking the perimeter of the triangle as 2s,
2s =a+b+c [Perimeter = the sum of the lengths of the three sides.]
1

Sos= (4 +6-+c) unit, Here s is the half of the perimeter of the triangle
We can easily determine the area of any triangle with the help of s and a, b,c.
The Formula for Determining the Area of Triangular Region

If in ABC, the length of the side AB is c, the length of the side BC is a and
the length of the side CA is b and perimeter is 2s. So area of AABC is
/s(s — a)(s — 6)(s —c) square unit [The proof has been given in the part of
mensuration of the Mathematics book of class 9-10. The students should check
out the proof.]

By the following examples, the use of the formula will be easily understood.
Observation: There are different formulas for determining the area of different
triangles but here we shall able to determine the area of any triangle with the
help of only one theory.

Method 2: Determination of the Area Using the Coordinates of the
Vertices

By this method the area of a triangle can be determined very easily with the
help of the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle. If the coordinates of the
vertices of any polygon are known, the area of the polygon can also be determined
in the same way. However, in real life, it is not possible to use this method. This
is because if we want to determine the area of a land and if the shape of the land
is triangle or square, the area can not be determined by this method since the
coordinates of the angular points are not known or are not possible to know. But
we can easily measure the length of the sides of a land and determine the area
by the Method 1. So, it is necessary for the students to have conceptions about
both methods. Method 2 for determining the area of triangles and polygons is
discussed below with examples:
The General Formula of Determining the Area of a Triangle: Let,
A(a1, 41), B(a2, yo) and C(az3, y3) be the three vertices of the triangle ABC. Like

Gradient or slope of a straight line
In this part of Coordinate Geometry, at first we shall discuss what Gradient or
Slope means and how to determine the Slope or the Gradient of a straight line. By
using the concept of the slope how the algebraic form of the straight line appears
to be will be discussed. If any straight line passes through two points, the nature
of that straight line and the determination of the equation of that straight line are
mainly the subject matter of the discussion. If two straight lines meet or intersect
at any point, determining the coordinates of that intersecting point and triangles
formed by three straight lines denoted by three equations will also be discussed.
Gradient or slope
In the figure beside, let’s consider the straight
line AB. The line passes through the two
points A(2,3) and B(6,7). According to the
figure, the line produces an angle 0 with
the positive side of z axis. The angle @ is HT] Fa

In reality, the relation between the slope m and the angle @ produced by any
straight line with the positive side of x-axis is, m = tan. In the figure above, in
case of AB, slope of the line is m = 1 ie., tan? = 1 or, 9 = 45° (an acute angle)

Note: In the above figure, it can be seen that the slope of the line AB is positive
and the angle produced is an acute angle. Again from the same figure, it is clear
that the slope of the line A B is negative and the angle produced is an obtuse
angle. Therefore, from the above discussion we come to the conclusion, if the slope
is positive, the angle produced by the line with the positive side of the z-axis is
an acute angle and if the slope is negative, the angle produced by the line with
the positive side of the z-axis is an obtuse angle.
If the produced angle is zero or right angle, what will be the slope? This has been
explained with the help of the following example:
Example 16. The coordinates of the three points A, B and C are respectively
(2,2), (5,2) and (2,7). Draw the lines AB and AC on the Cartesian plane. If
possible, find the slopes of the lines AB and AC.

Solution: The lines AB and AC have been drawn on the Cartesian plane. &

Observe: If 2; = 2», the line is parallel to the y-axis i.e., a perpendicular on the
a-axis. It is not possible to walk on the perpendicular line or the vertical line. So,
the determination of the slope is not possible.
Remark: In the above figure, on any point of the line AB, the ordinate i.e.,
y = 2 and on any point of the line AC, the abscissa i.e., = 2. Therefore, the
equation of the straight line AB is y = 2 and the equation of the straight line AC
isz=2.

equation (3) or (5) is the single equation of x and y and it indicates a straight line.

So, undoubtedly it can be said that the single equation of x and y always indicates

a straight line. The equations (3) and (5) can be expressed in the following way:

Example 21. The slope of a definite straight line is 3 and the connecting point
of the line is (—2, —3). Find the equation of the line.
Solution: Given that, slope m = 3 and the definite point (71,41) = (—2, —3)
.. The equation of the line, y — y. = m(a# — 21)
or, y — (—3) = 3{x — (-2)}
or, y+3 = 3(@+ 2)

Example 22. The straight line y = 32 + 3 passes through the point P(¢, 4).
Find the coordinate of P. The line intersects the z-axis and the y-axis on the
points A and B respectively. Find the coordinates of the points A and B.
Solution: The point P(t, 4) lies on the line y = 3z + 3; so coordinates of P will

Again, the line y = 32 + 3 intersects the y-axis at B. So, the abscissa or z
coordinate of the point B is 0. [Since z is 0 on all points of the y-axis.]
So, y=3-0+3 or, y=3
.. Coordinate of B is (0,3)
Now, draw the line AB on the Cartesian plane. The line AB intersects the z-axis
at the point (—1,0) and the y-axis at the point (0,3). ie., when the value of x is
-1, the line y = 3” + 3 intersects the z-axis. Again, when the value of y is 3, the 3
line intersects the y-axis. So, the bisector x of the line is —1 and bisector y is 3. %

Chapter 11. Coordinate Geometry 281
The general equation of such straight line which is not vertical can be expressed
in the following way.
Here, the slope of the line is m and c is the bisector of the y-axis. For m > 0 and
c > 0 of the line is shown in the first figure.
Again, parallel to the y-axis, i.e., the general equation of the perpendicular line
on the a-axis is x = a. In the same way, parallel to the x-axis, i.e., the general
equation of the perpendicular line on the y-axis is y = b. See the first figure.
Observed, as the value of c is positive, the line y = ma + c intersects c to the
positive side of the y-axis at a single distance. As the value of m(m = tan@ > 0)
is positive, the angle produced by the line y = mz +c is an acute angle. As the
values of a and 6 are positive, the line z = a has been on the right side of the
y-axis and the line y = b has been shown above the z-axis.
In the case of the negative values of a, b and c, the position of the lines are shown
in the second figure.

From first two figures and above discussion, we can say clearly, if c = 0, the line

Planar Vector
In physics, we have learnt about two types of quantities. One type is denoted only
by the magnitude (quantity being measured by using addition + or substraction
— signs). The other type requires both magnitude and direction. The first one is
known as scalar and the second as vector. We shall discuss about vector quantities
in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to-

> describe scalar and vector quantities.

> explain scalar and vector quantities with symbols.

> explain equal vector, opposite vector and position vector.

> explain vector addition and rules of vector addition.

> explain the subtraction of vectors.

> explain the scalar multiple of vectors and a unit vector.

> explain the scalar multiple of vectors and the distributive law.

> solve different geometrical problems using vectors.
Scalar and Vector Quantities
Measurement of things is necessary in all spheres of our daily life. Length of a
body, measure of time, amount of money, measurement of volume and temperature
can be denoted by 5 cm., 3 minutes, 12 taka, 5 litres and 6° C, respectively. For
these measurements, it is sufficient to state those quantities with their respective
units. Again, if it is stated that a man starting from a point first travels 4 metres
and then 5 metres; then to determine his distance from the starting point, it is
necessary to know the direction of his motion. It is not possible to determine
correctly how far the man has moved from the starting point unless the exact
direction of the motion is known.
The quantity which is completely described by its magnitude with a unit or + or — eS
signs before magnitude is a Scalar Quantity. Length, mass, speed, temperature %

Chapter 12. Planar Vector 289
etc. are scalar quantities.
The quantity which, for its complete description, requires magnitude as well as
direction is a Vector Quantity. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, weight,
force etc. are vector quantities.
Geometrical interpretation of a vector: directed line segment
If one end of a straight line is termed as the initial point and the other end as the
terminal point then the straight line is called a directed line segment. The
directed line segment whose initial point is A and terminal point is B is denoted
by AB. Each directed line segment is a vector quantity whose measurement is
the length of the line segment (represented by (|AB]) or shortly AB) and whose
direction is along the line AB straight from A to B.
Conversely, any vector quantity can be expressed by a directed line segment where
the length of the line segment is the measurement of the vector quantity and the
direction represented from initial point to terminal point is the direction of the
vector. Hence, vector quantity and directed line segment are the same. Directed
line segments are also called Geometric Vectors. Our discussion will be limited
to the vectors in a plane. By vector we shall mean Geometric Vectors.
Any vector (directed line segment) which is a part of an unending straight line is
called the support line or just support of the vector.
Usually a vector is represented by a letter e.g. u = AB. To denote a vector, the
vector is underscored and its directive line segment is adorned with a — above.
“= AB means the initial point of the vector u is A and terminal point is B; its
direction is from A to B and its length |u| = |AB | is the length of the line segment
AB.

Equivalence of vectors and Opposite vector
Equal vector: A vector u is said to be equal to another vector v if
1) |u| = |v| (Length of u is equal to length of v )
2) Supports of u and v are same or parallel.
3) Directions of u and v are same.
uv
Cc —— > D
u v u
A ——— B Cc — D A——B
It is easily understood that the definition of equivalence abides by the following
rules:
1) u=u
2) Ifu=v,v=u
3) Ifu=vandu=w,u=w
If the support lines of u and v are same or parallel then we call briefly u and v
are parallel.
Note: A vector can be drawn at any point which is equal to a given vector.
Because if a point P and a vector u are given, we draw a straight line at the point
P which is parallel to support line of u. Now we take PQ line segment to the
direction of u and equal to |u| . Then according to the construction, PO =u.
Opposite vector: v is called the opposite vector of u if
1) |e = lel
2) Lines of support of u and v are the same and parallel.
3) The direction of v is opposite of that of u
If v is an opposite vector of u then u is also opposite of v. It is clear from the
definition of equality that if both v then w be opposite vectors of u then v = w.
—u is the opposite vector of u. If u= AB then -—u = BA.
Addition of Vectors
If from the terminal point of a vector u another vector v is drawn, then u + v
denotes such a vector whose initial point is the initial point of u and terminal Sy
point is the terminal point of v . s

Chapter 12. Planar Vector 291
Let AB =u, BC = v be two vectors such that the terminal point of u is the initial
point of v then the vector AC joining the initial point of u and the terminal point
of v is called the sum of the vectors u and v and is denoted by u + v
Cc
UtY :

Triangle law of addition of vectors: In the above diagram, if u and v are
not parallel to each other then u, v and u + v vectors form a triangle; hence, this
addition system is called triangle law.
As a corollary to the triangle law of addition of vectors parallelogram law of
addition of vectors is as follows:
Parallelogram law of addition of vectors: If the magnitude and direction
of two vectors u and v are denoted by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram
then the magnitude and direction of u + vu is denoted by that diagonal of the
parallelogram which passes through the point of intersection of the lines denoting
the two vectors. We shall prove it now.
p«/ )
oO a A
Proof: Let OA and OB denote the vectors u and v drawn from any point, O.
Draw the parallelogram OACB and its diagonal Oe. Then the diagonal reyes of
the parallelogram will denote the sum of u and y, ie. oe =ut+v.
In the parallelogram OACB, we have OB and AC equal and parallel. .°. AC =
OB= v [by transfer of vectors]
.. Using triangle law, u+ uv = OA + OB = OA + AC = oc [Proved]
Note: 1) The sum of two or more vectors is also said to be their resultant.
The method of adition of vectors is followed in determining the resultant of forces
8 or velocities. 2) If the two vectors are parallel, the parallelogram law is not
“applicable to their addition but the triangle law is applicable in all the cases.

Subtraction of vectors
The subtraction of the vectors u and v is u—v and it is equivalent to the addition
of u and —v (opposite vector of v) ie. u+ (—v).

A a B
Triangle law of subtraction of vectors: If the initial points of u and v are
same then initial point of u — v will be the same as the final point of v and the
final point of u—v will be the same as the final point of u. In short, the difference
of two vectors with same initial point is the opposite vector formed by the initial
points. Therefore, if u = AB, v= AC then u—v = OB, ie. AB = AC = CB.
We shall prove it now.

E F

Proof: Line segment CA is produced such that AE = CA, parallelogram AE FB
is drawn. According to the parallelogram law of additions of vectors AE + AB =
AF.
Again AFBC is a parallelogram, as BF = AE = C/A and since BF || AE, then
BF | CA.
& AF =CB (by transfer of vector), but AB = —v and AB = u
Therefore u —v = CB is proved.
Zero Vector
A vector whose absolute value is zero and whose direction cannot be determined 8
is called a zero vector. SN

Chapter 12. Planar Vector 293
—u u
A —_ cu B
If u is any vector,then what is the value of u + (—u)?
Let u = AB then —u = BA.
Hence, u— u= AB + BA=AA [by triangle law]
But what kind of vector is AA? Its initial point and final point are same. Hence
its length is zero. i.e. AA is to be understood as the point A. This kind of vector
(whose length is zero) is called zero vector and denoted by the symbol 0. This is
the only vector which has no fixed direction and support line.
For the introduction of zero vector we can say that u+ (—u) = 0 andu+0=
O+u=u
Virtually trial identity is involved with zero vector.
Laws of Vector Addition
Just like arithmetical addition, in vector addition commutative, associative and
cancellation law can be used.
Commutative law: For any two vectors u,v ,wegetu+tu=v+u
u
B C
O 5 A
Proof: Let OA = u and OB = vu. Draw the parallelogram OACB and its
diagonal OC. OA and BC are equal and parallel. Also OB and AC are equal
and parallel.
-. OC = 0A + AC =u +0; again, OC = OB + BC =0B+0A=v+u
“.u+u=v+4 Therefore, addition of vectors obeys commutative law.
Associative law of addition of vectors: For any three vectors u, v, w we
have
(u+v)+w=ut+(utw)
3 Proof: Let, OA = u, AB = v, BC = w, i.e. v is drawn from the terminal of u
‘and w is drawn from the terminal point of v. Join O, C and A, C.

294 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
C

Uv

Then (u+v) + w=(OA+ AB) + BC = 0B+BC = 06
Again, u+(v+w) =OA+(AB + BC) =0A+ AC = 00
v(wtv)+w=u+t(u+w); Hence vector addition obeys associative law.
Corollary 1. The sum of three vectors represented by the three sides of a
triangle taken in the same order is zero. In the diagram above, OB + BA + 46 =
OA+ AO = -AO + AO =0
Cancellation law of addition of vector: For any three vectors u, v, w, if
u+v=utw then, v=w

Proof: Asu+u=u+w
vutut (-u) =ut+w+ (-u) [Adding —u in both sides]

Scalar multiple of a vector
If u is any vector and m is any real number, then what is understood by mu is
explained here now.
1. Ifm=0 then, mu = 0 or zero vector
2. Ifm #0 then, the length of mu is equal to |m| times that of u and the
supports of mu are same as that of u’s. And,
1) If m > 0, then direction of mu and that of u are same. ©
2) Ifm <0, then direction of mu and that of u are opposite. 8

Chapter 12. Planar Vector 295
Note: 1) ifm=0oru=0, then mu=02) lu=u,(-1l)u=—-u
From the above definition, it is observed that, m(nu) = n(mu) = (mn)(u)
Both m,n > 0, both < 0, any one > 0 and the other < 0, any one or both
is zero -after considering all these case separately, the reality of the rule can be
established. An Example of such cases is given below

lat ot pat ta
Suppose, AB = BC =U
AC is produced up to G, such that CD = DE = EF = FG = AB.
Then AC = AB+ BC +CD+DE+EP+FC =ututututu+u=6u
Again, AG = AC + OE + EC = 2u + 2u + 2u = 3(2u)
And AG = AB + DG = 3u + 3u = 2(3u)
, 2(3u) = 3(2u) = 2 x 3(u)
Note: If support lines of two vectors are alike or parallel, then one can be
expressed as scalar multiple of the other.
_. |AB| AB
In reality, if AB || CD then, AB = mCDB where, |m| = ia = GD
1) ifm>O0, AB and CD are alike in direction,
2) ifm<0O, AB and CD are unlike in direction,
Distribution laws concerning scalar multiples of vectors
If m,n are two scalars and u and v are two vectors then
1. (m+n)u=mut nu
2. m(utv) =mu+mv
Formula 1. (m+n)u=mu+nu
ua
« Proof: If m or n is zero, then the law is obviously true.
Ss Suppose both m and n are both positive and AB = mu. |AB| = mul

296 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
AB is produced up to C so that |BC| = nlu| & BC = nu
|AC| = |AB| + [BC] = mlu| + nlul =(m+n)ul +. AC = (m+ n)u
But AC = AB + BC “mut nu =(m+n)u
If both m,n are negative, then the length of (m+ n)u is |(m+n)||u| and the
direction will be opposite direction of u, so the length of the vector mu + nu will
be |m||u| + |n||u| = (|m| + |n|)|u| and the direction will be opposite of u. But, if
m <0 and n <0 then, |m|+|n| = |m-+ nl]. In that case, (m+ n)u = mu + nu.
Lastly, if among m and n, m > 0 and n < 0, then the length of (m+ n)u will
be (|m| — |n|)|u| and direction will be aligned with that of u, when |m| > |n| and
opposite to direction of u, then then vector mu + nu will be aligned in direction
of (m+ n)u and their lengths will be same.
Observation: Three points A, B,C will be co-linear if and only if AC be a scalar
multiple of AB
Remark: 1) If support lines of two vectors are alike or parallel and their
directions are alike, then the vectors are called similar vectors . 2) The vector
whose length is 1 unit is called a unit vector.

Position Vector
With respect to a given point O in a plane, the position of any point P in the
plane can be fixed by OP. OP is called the position vector of P with respect to
O and O is called the vector origin.
o —_?__ p
Let O be a fixed point in a plane and A is another point in the same plane. The
vector OA produced by joining O and A is called the position vector of A with
respect to O. Similarly, OB is the position vector of another point B in the same
plane with respect to the same point O.

Join A, B; Let, oA = a,OB =b
Then OA+ AB = OB ie. a+AB=b
an AB =b-a
Thus if the position vectors of two points are known, then the vector denoted by
the line joining them can be obtained by subtracting the position vector of the
initial point from that of the terminal point of the vector.
Observation: The position vector of a certain point may be different with respect
to different vector origins. In solving a particular problem the position vector of
all points of the problem are supposed with respect to the same origin.
Work: Take a point O as origin on a page of your khatha. Then take
another 5 points on it at different positions and draw their position vectors
with respect to O.

Solid Geometry
Solids of different shapes are always needed and used in our practical life. Among
these, there are regular and irregular solids. The method of determining volumes
and areas of surfaces of regular solids and compound solids constructed of two
regular solids will be discussed in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —
> draw the symbolic diagram of a solid
» determine volumes and areas of surfaces of prism, solids of pyramid shape,
spheres and right circular cones
> solve problems using the knowledge of solid geometry
b> measure volumes and areas of surfaces of compound solids
» apply the knowledge of solid geometry in practical areas
Basic Concepts
Basic concepts of points, lines and planes have been discussed in secondary
general geometry. In solid geometry point, lines and planes are considered as
basic concepts.

1. Each of length, breadth and height of a body is called a dimension of the
body.

2. A point has no length, breadth or thickness. It is an assumption. For
practical purpose, we use a dot (-) to indicate a point. It can be called a
replica of position. Hence a point has no dimension. So it is
zero-dimensional.

3. A line has length only, but no breadth and height. Hence a line is one
dimensional. For example, in the figure below, AB is a line.

4. A surface has length and breadth, but no height. Hence a surface is two-
dimensional. For example, in the figure below, ABGF is a surface.

Forma -39, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

306 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
5. A body having length, breadth and thickness is called a solid. Hence a solid
is three dimensional. For example, in the figure below, ABCDEFG is a
body.

Some Elementary Definition
Drawing a three-dimensional figure on a two-dimensional page or board is a bit
complex. So, drawing pictures with definitions in the classroom will help the
students grasp the concepts easily.

1. Plane surface: If the straight line joining any two points on a surface lies
totally on that surface, then the surface is called a plane surface or simply a
plane. The upper surface of the still water of a pond is a plane. The smooth
floor of a room polished with cement or mosaic is considered to be a plane.
But geometrically it is not a plane, for there are high and low points on the
floor. In the above picture, ABCD, ADEF, ABGF all are planes.
Observation: Unless otherwise mentioned, lines and planes in solid
geometry are regarded as infinitely extended. Hence it may be inferred
from the definition of a plane that if one part of a straight line lies in a
plane then the other part cannot be outside it.

2. Curved surface: If the straight line joining any two points on a surface
does not lie wholly in the surface, then the surface is called a curved surface.
The surface of a sphere is a curved surface.

3. Solid geometry: The branch of mathematics which concerns with the
properties of solids and surfaces, lines and points is called solid geometry.
Sometimes it is called Geometry of Space or Geometry of Three Dimensions.

4. Coplanar straight lines: If two or more straight lines lie in the same plane
or a plane can be made to pass through them, then these straight lines are Sy
said to be coplanar. In the figure above AB and C'D are coplanar straight ‘

Chapter 13. Solid Geometry 307
lines but HF is not coplanar with them.

5. Skew or non coplanar lines: Straight lines which do not lie in one plane
or through which a plane cannot be made to pass are called skew or non-
coplanar straight lines. In the figure above, AB and EF are skew lines. If
two pencils are tied cross-wise like a plus sign or a multiplication sign, two
non-coplanar lines are formed.

6. Parallel Straight lines: Two coplanar straight lines are said to be parallel,
when they do not intersect each other, i.e., they have no common point. In
the figure above, AB and CD are parallel straight lines.

7. Parallel planes or surfaces: Two planes are said to be parallel when they
do not intersect, that is, they do not have any common point. In the figure
above ABCD and EFGH are parallel planes.

8. Line parallel to a plane: If a plane and a straight line are such that they
do not intersect though they are extended indefinitely, then the straight line
is said to be parallel to the plane. In the figure above, C’D is parallel to
plane ABGF.

9. Normal or perpendicular to a plane: A straight line is said to be normal
or perpendicular to a plane when it is perpendicular to every straight line in
the plane meets it. In the figure below on left, OP is normal to the plane,
as it is normal to all of AB, CD, EF residing on the plane.

10. Oblique Line: A straight line is said to be an oblique line to a plane if
it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the plane. In the figure above on
right, MN, ST are oblique lines.
11. Vertical Line of Plane: A straight line or a plane is said to be vertical
8 when it is parallel to plumb line hanging freely at rest. In the figure below

12. Horizontal line or plane: A plane is said to be horizontal when it is
perpendicular to a vertical line. Again a straight line is said to be horizontal
when it is perpendicular to a vertical line or when it lies in a horizontal plane.
In the figure above on left, ABEF is a horizontal plane and PQ horizontal
line.

13. Planar and skew quadrilateral: A quadrilateral is said to be plane when
its sides lie in the same plane. Again a quadrilateral whose sides do not lie
in the same plane is called skew quadrilateral. Two adjacent sides of a skew
quadrilateral lie in one plane and the other two adjacent sides lie in another
plane. Hence the opposite sides of a skew quadrilateral are also skew. In
the above figure on right, ABEF is a planar quadrilateral and BCFE is a
skew quadrilateral.

14. Angle between two skew straight lines: The angle between two skew
straight lines is the angle between one of them and the line drawn through
any point in that line parallel to other. Again if two straight lines parallel
to skew straight lines are drawn at a point, then the angle formed at that
point is equal to the angle between the skew straight lines.

Let AB and C’D be the skew lines. Take any point O and through O, draw
OP, OQ, parallel to AB,CD respectively. Then the angle POQ indicates
the angle between the skew lines AB and CD. In other words, 7BRQ also
denotes the angle between AB and C’D where R is on AB and QR is parallel 3
to CD. N

Chapter 13. Solid Geometry 309
15. Dihedral angle: If two planes intersect in a straight line, then the angle
between the two straight lines drawn from any point on the line of
intersection and at right angles to the intersection line is called a dihedral
angle.
.
ce B
The two planes AB and CD intersect along the straight line AC. From
O, any point on AC, two straight lines OM in the plane AB and ON
in the plane C'D are drawn such that each is perpendicular to AC at O.
Then Z7MON is the dihedral angle between the plane AB and CD. Two
intersecting planes are said to be perpendicular to each other when the
dihedral angle between them is a right angle.

16. Projection: The projection of a point on a given line or a plane is the
foot of the perpendicular drawn from the point to the line or plane. The
projection of a line straight or curved on a plane is the locus of the feet
of the perpendiculars drawn from all points in the given line to the given
plane. It is also called orthogonal projection. In the figure, projections of
a curved line AB on plane XY and a line CD are shown as curved line ab
and straight line cd.

Relation between two straight lines
g 1) Two straight lines may be coplanar in which case they must either be parallel
N or meet in a point.

310 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
2) Two straight lines may be skew in which case they will neither be parallel
nor will they meet in a point.
Axioms
1) A straight line joining any two points in a plane lies wholly in that plane,
though produced indefinitely. Hence if a straight line and a plane have
two common points, they will have innumberable common points along the
straight line.
2) An infinite number of planes can be drawn through one or two given straight
lines.
Relation between a straight line and a plane
1) Ifa straight line is parallel to a plane, then there will be no common point
between them.
2) Ifa straight line cuts a plane, then they will have one and only one point
common to them.
3) If a straight line and a plane have two common points then the line will
completely coincide with the plane
Relation between two planes
1) If two planes are parallel then they will have no common point.
2) If two planes intersect each other, then they will intersect one another in a
straight line and they will have innumerable common points.
Solid
We know that a book, a brick, a box or a spherical ball is a solid and occupies
some space. Again, a piece of stone or wood, a part of a brick, a fragment of coal,
a lump of dried sticky soil etc are also examples of solids. But these are irregular
solids.
The body enclosed by plane or curved surfaces and occupying some space is called
a solid. At least three straight lines are required to enclose a portion of a plane,
so also four planes are required to enclose some space. These planes are the faces
or the surfaces of the solid and the line in which two such planes intersect is an
edge of the solid. A book or a brick has six faces and twelve edges. A cricket ball 2
is enclosed by a curved surface. S

1. Rectangular Parallelepiped

At 7 7
°
Ae lp
The solid enclosed by three pairs of parallel planes is called a
parallelepiped. Each of the six planes is a parallelogram and the opposite
faces are congruent. A parallelepiped has twelve edges divided into three
groups.
The parallelepiped of which the faces are rectangles is called a rectangular
parallelepiped. The rectangular parallelepiped of which the faces are squares
is called a cube. The faces of the rectangular parallelepiped and the faces of
the cube in the above diagram are ABCD, A’B'C'D', BCC’B’, ADD'A’,
ABB'A', DCC'D’ and the edges are AB, A’B’, CD, C'D’, BC, B'C’, AD,
A'D', AA’, BB’, CC’, DD’. The only diagonal shown is BD’, the rest have
to be drawn.
Let the length, breadth and height of the rectangular parallelepiped be
respectively AB = a units, AD = b units and AA’ = c units.
1) Area of the whole surface

= Sum of the areas of the six faces

= 2 (the area of the face ABCD + the area of the face ABB A+ the

area of the face ADD A ) = 2(ab+ac+bc) square units = 2(ab-+bc+ca)

oo square units

312 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
3) Diagonal
BD! = /BD? + DD? = AB? + AD? + DD? = V2 +P +2 unit
2. Cube
For a cube, a = b =c, Therefore,
1) Area of the whole surface = 2(a? + a? + a?) = 6a? square units
2) =a -a:a=a? cubic units
3) = Ve +04 a2 = V3a units
Example 1. A rectangular parallelepiped has its length, breadth and
height in the ratio 4: 3: 2 and the area of its whole surface is 468 square
metres; find the diagonal and the volume of it.
Solution: Let the length, breadth and height be respectively 4x, 3x” and
2x metres.
Then, 2(42 - 3a + 3a - 2x + 2x - 4x) = 468
or, 52x? = 468 or, 22 =9 «. r=3
.. The length of the solid is 12 metres, the breadth is 9 metres and the height
is 6 metres.
Hence, the length of the diagonal = W/12?+92+6? metres =
V144 + 81 + 36 = V261 metres + 16.16 metres(approx.)
And volume = 12 x 9 x 6 = 648 cubic metres
Work: Measure the length, breadth and height of a hardboard box
(cartoon or box containing a bottle of medicine) and find its volume,
area of six surfaces and the length of a diagonal.
3. Prism
A prism is a polyhedron, bounded by two parallel polygonal faces and the
other faces always being parallelograms. The parallel sides are known as
bases and the sides are known as lateral faces. If all the lateral surfaces
are rectangular it is called a right prism; otherwise they are called oblique
prism. Practically right prisms are frequently used. The prism is named by
the shape of its base. For example, triangular prism, quadrilateral prism, eS
pentagonal prism etc. &

Chapter 13. Solid Geometry 313
a
b eS i base vv
If the base is a regular polygon, the prism is called a regular prism. If the
base is not a regular polygon, the prism is known as an irregular prism.
So by definition all rectangular solids and cubes are prisms. Right triangular
prism made of glass is used for scattering of light.
1) The area of total surfaces of a prism
= 2 (area of the base) + area of the lateral surfaces
= 2 (area of the base) + perimeter of the base x height
2) volume = area of the base x height
Example 2. The lengths of the sides of the base of a triangular prism are
3,4 and 5 cm respectively and height is 8 cm. Find the volume and area of
its total surfaces.
Solution: The lengths of the sides of the base of the prism are 3 cm, 4 cm
and 5 cm respectively.
1
Since 374? = 5%, its base is a right angled triangle whose area= 3% 4x3 =6
sg. cm. So, the area of all the surfaces = 2x6+(3+4+5) x8 = 12+96 = 108
sq. cm. and volume of the prism = 6 x 8 = 48 cubic cm.
So, the area of all the surfaces is 60 sq. cm. and the volume is 48 cubic cm.
4. Pyramid

A solid figure with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a
common point is called a pyramid.

vertex
pn
The base of a pyramid is a any polygon and its lateral surfaces are of any
triangular shape. But if the base is a regular polygon and the lateral faces are
congruent triangles, the pyramid is called regular pyramid. The regular
pyramids are eye-catching. The line joining the vertex and any corner of
the base is called the edge of the pyramid. The length of the perpendicular
from the vertex to the base is called the height of the pyramid. Usually, a
solid with a square base and four congruent triangles meeting at a point is
considered as a pyramid. These pyramids are in wide use.
A solid enclosed by four equilateral triangles is known as regular
tetrahedron which is also a pyramid. This pyramid has 3+ 3 = 6 edges
and 4 vertices. The perpendicular from the vertex falls on the centroid of
the base.
1) The area of all surfaces of pyramid = Area of the base + area of the
lateral surfaces
But if the lateral surfaces are congruent triangles,
1
The area of all surafes of the pyramid = Area of the base+ 5 (perimeter
of the base x slant height)
If the height of the perimid is h, radius of the inscribed circle of the
base is r and 1 is its slant height, then 1 = /h? + r?
1
2) volume = 3% area of the base x height
Example 3. The height of a pyramid with a square base of side 10 cm.
is 12 cm. Find its area of all surfaces and the volume.
Solution: The perpendicular distance of any side of the base from the
10 S
centre r = 7 om = 5 cm., The hright of the pyramid is 12 cm. g

Chapter 13. Solid Geometry 315
Therefore, the slant height of any lateral surface = Vh? + r? = 12? + 5?
= 71444 25 = V169 = 13 cm.

.. The area of all the faces = [10 x 10+ 54 x 10) x 13] sq. cm.
= 100 + 260 = 360 sq. cm.
1
And its volume = 3 * (10 x 10) x 12 cubic cm. = 10 x 10 x 4 = 400 cubic
cm.
Therefore, the area of all surfaces of the pyramid is 360 sq. cm. and the
volume is 400 cubic cm.

7. Compound solid
A solid body consisting of two solids is a compound solid. Exaples of a few
compound solids are:

1) A prism placed on a rectangular solid is a compound solid when both
of them have identical surface.

2) If the base of a triangular prism and that of a regular tetrahedron are
identical, they can be used to make a compound solid.

3) Ifthe radius of a sphere and that of the base of a cone are equal, they
can form together a compound solid.

4) A capsule is a compound solid having two identical hemispheres at two
ends of a circular cylinder with base radius equal to the radius of each
hemisphere.

In this way, two or more solids can be combined together to make a
99 compound solid. Many beautiful architectural constructions are compound
R solids. The items used for exercises are made of such compound solids.

Probability
In our everyday life we frequently use the word ‘probability’? For example, the
probability of Jaadob passing the SSC examination this year is really poor, the
probability of Bangladesh winning the Asia cup is high, the probability of the
temperature rising tomorrow is high, the probability of raining today is very thin
etc.
Therefore, we talk about probability only when there is a doubt about an event
occurring. And the possibility of the event occurring also depends on the
magnitude of non-occurrence. But this procedure can not give any numerical
value. In this chapter, we will know about different formulas and procedures for
assigning a numerical value to the probability of the occurrence of an event, and
we will also be able to describe certain events, impossible events and possible
events after studying this chapter.
After studying this chapter, students will be able to —

>» Explain the concept of probability.

» Describe certain events, impossible events and possible events by giving

daily-life examples.

» Describe the consequences of repetition of an event.

» Find the probability of an event happening repeatedly.

> Solve simple and real-life problems regarding probability.
Basic Concepts Related to Probability
Random Experiment: A random experiment is where you know all possible
outcomes of the experiment, but you can not say the exact outcome of a certain eS
attempt in this experiment. For example, we know all the outcomes of throwing %

Chapter 14. Probability 327
a dice, but we can not exactly tell which outcome will occur before throwing the
dice. So the experiment of throwing a dice is a random experiment.
Event: An outcome or a combination of outcomes of an experiment is called an
event. For example, getting 3 after throwing a dice is an event. Again, getting an
even number in this regard is also an event.
Equally Likely Events: If the possibilities of the outcomes of a random
experiment occurring are same, which means that no outcome is more or less
likely to happen than any other outcome, than the possible outcomes are called
equally likely events. For example, the occurrence of a head or a tail in the
tossing of a coin are equally likely events, unless the coin is defective or biased in
some way. Therefore, getting head and tail are equally likely events.
Mutually Exclusive Events: Two or more possible outcomes of a random
experiment are called mutually exclusive event if the occurrence of one of those
events precludes the possibility of the other events. For example, in the tossing
of a coin, the occurrence of a head and a tail are mutually exclusive events since
if head occurs then tail can not occur and vice versa. That means head and tail
can not occur at the same time.
Favourable Outcomes: The outcome of interest of an event in an experiment
is called favourable outcome. The number of favourable outcomes of getting an
odd number on throwing a dice is 3.
Sample Space and Sample Point: The set of all possible outcomes of a
random experiment is called the sample space. The tossing of a coin has two
possible outcomes: Head and Tail. If the result of this experiment is expressed
as S, we can write S = {H,T}. So in this case the sample space is S = {H,T}.
Suppose two coins are tossed simultaneously. Then the sample space is S =
{HH,HT,TH,TT}. Every element of a sample space is called a sample point.
The experiment of throwing a dice once has the sample space S = {H,T}, and
here each of H,T is a sample point.
Determination of Logic-Based Probabilities
Example 1. Suppose an unbiased dice is thrown. What is the probability of
getting 5?
Sy Solution: The possible outcomes of throwing a dice are: 1,2,3,4,5,6. Since
“the dice is unbiased, these outcomes are all equally likely. So the possibility of a

328 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
particular outcome is one-sixth. So the probability of getting 5 is 6 We write
1
this as P(5) = 6°
Example 2. What is the probability of getting an even number on throwing
an unbiased dice?
Solution: The possible outcomes of throwing a dice are 1,2,3,4,5,6. The even
numbers among these outcomes are 2, 4, 6. So there are three outcomes where we
can get an even number on the dice, which means there are 3 favourable outcomes.
As all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of getting an even number on
3
the dice is e
3
.. P (even number) = e
So we can formalize the following definition of probability:
. number of cases favourable to the event
Probability of an event = 22
total number of possible outcomes
The number of cases favourable to an event can be minimum zero and maximum
n {all possible outcomes). If there is no case favourable to an event then
probability becomes zero. And when the amount of favourable outcome is n,
then the probability is 1. Therefore, the probability of an event ranges from 0 to
1.
Two Special Events
Certain Events: An event which is sure to occur is called a certain event. The
probability of any certain event is 1. For an instance, the probability that the
sun will rise tomorrow from the east is 1, the probability that the sun will set in
the west in this evening is likewise 1. The probability of not seeing the sun in
the night is also 1. The probability of getting H or T is also 1. The probability
of getting even or odd in an experiment of throwing dice is also 1. These are all
certain events.
Impossible Events: An event which will not occur, that means which is not
possible to occur in an experiment is called an impossible event. The probability
of an impossible event is zero. For instance, the probability that tomorrow the
sun will rise in the west or set in the east, is zero. The probability of seeing the
sun in the night is zero too. Similarly, the probability of getting a 7 in throwing 3
a dice is also zero. All these events mentioned here are impossible events. N

Example 3. In a bag there are 4 red, 5 white and 6 black balls. A ball is
chosen at random. What is the probability that the ball will be 1) red, 2) white
and 3) black ?
Solution: Total number of balls in the bag is 15. If a ball is chosen randomly,
any of the 15 balls may be drawn. Therefore total number of outcomes = 15.
1) Suppose the event of drawing a red ball is R. There are 4 red balls in the
bag. So the number of favourable cases for this event = 4.
- P(R) = number of events favourable to draw a red ball _ 4
— ~ total number of outcomes ~ 15°
2) Suppose the event of drawing a white ball is W. There are 5 white balls in
the bag. So the number of favourable cases for this event = 5. ... P(W) =
number of events favourable to draw a white ball 5 1
total number of outcomes ~15° 3°
3) Suppose the event of drawing a red ball is B. There are 6 black balls in the
bag. So number of favourable cases for the event = 6.
 P(B) = number of events favourable to draw a black ball _ 6 2
“ 7 total number of outcomes ~ 15° 5
Work:

1) An unbiased dice is thrown. Find the probability of getting:

(z) 4 (44) an odd number (iit) 4 or a number greater than 4 (iv) a number
less than 5.

2) A bag contains similar type of 6 black, 5 red, 8 white marbles. A marble
is drawn at random from the bag. Find the probability that the marble
is:

(i) red (ii) black (ii) white (iv) not black.

Data Based Probability

In the logical approach to determining probabilities, the outcomes are required
to be equally likely. However, in reality the outcomes are not equally likely in
all cases. Moreover, in many situations, it is not possible to apply the logical
approach. For example, today’s weather forecast says that the probability of
raining today is 30%, the probability of Brazil winning the world football cup is
40%, the probability of Bangladesh winning the Asia cup is 60%. Then statement
Forma -42, Higher Mathe, Class-9-10

330 Higher Mathematics Classes IX-X
are based on statistics or data of past records and this is the concept of data-based
probability.
Suppose, a coin is tossed 1000 tated pice resulted in head 523 times. So the
relative frequency of getting head is 7000 = 0.523. Suppose, a coin is tossed 2000
times which resulted in head 1030 times. So the relative frequency of H in 2000
times is non = 0.515. From this we can understand that, the more times an
experiment (tossing of a coin) is done, the closer the relative frequency will be to
the probability of getting a head in a single tossing of the coin. This is called data
based probability.
Example 4. According to meteorological records, it rained on 21 days in the
month of July last year. What is the probability that it will rain on fourth of July
this year?
Solution: As out of the 31 days in the month of July, it rained on total 21 i
last year, the probability of raining on a particular day of July this year is 31°
21
Therefore the probability of raining on fourth of July is 31°
Example 5. In a survey among the readers of newspapers, it was found that
65 persons read the Prothom Alo, 40 persons read the Bhorer Kagoj, 45 read the
Janakantho, 52 read the Jugantor. If one person is chosen at random from there
readers, what is the probability that the person reads the Jugantor? What is the
probability that the person does not read the Prothom Alo?
Solution: Here, the total number of readers is (65 + 40 + 45 + 52) = 202.
The number of persons reading the Jugantor is 52. So, the probability that the
2
chosen person reads the Jugantor is =
65 persons read the Prothom Alo. Number of persons who do not read the
Prothom Alo is (202 — 65) = 137. So, the probability that the person does not
137
d the Prothom Alo is = —~
read the Prothom Alo is = 555
Work: Ina survey among the first year students in a university, it is found
that 284 students have taken Economics, 106 have taken History, 253 have
taken Sociology, 169 have taken English. If a student is chosen at random, %6
what is the probability that the student has not taken Sociology? ES

Chapter 14. Probability 331
Determination of Probability using Sample Space and Probability Tree
It has been already mentioned that the set of all possible outcomes of an

experiment is called the sample space. Often the sample space of an experiment

is quite large. In such cases, the counting of all sample points and the formation

of the sample space may be cumbersome and can even lead to mistakes. In such

cases we may build the sample space by using the probability tree, and use it to

find the probability of various events.

Example 6. Suppose, two unbiased coins are tossed together. Form the sample

space, find the probability of getting H on first coin and T on second coin.

Solution: The tossing of two coins may be treated as a two step process. In the

first step, one of the coin is tossed which may result in either H or T. In the

second step, the other coin is tossed which may, likewise, result in either H or

T. All possible outcomes of this experiment may be exhibited in the form of a

probability tree diagram as follows :

Outcome of first coin
Outcome of second coin| | Outcome of second coin
H H
So the sample points are: HH,HT,TH,TT. So the sample space will be
{HH, HT,TH,TT}. Here the number of sample points is 4 and the probability
1
of observing a sample point is a So the probability of getting H on the first
1

coin and the probability of getting T on the second coin will be, P(HT) = r

Example 7. Suppose, an unbiased coin is tossed thrice. Show the sample space

using a probability tree and find the probabilities of the each of the following

events. 1) getting just one tail, 2) getting head in all three tossings, 3) getting

at least one tail.

Solution: The tossing of the coin three times may be treated as a there step
8 process. In each toss the number of possible outcomes are two, which are H or T.
“ The total result is shown below, using probability tree:

The sample space is: {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT,THH,THT,TTH, TTT}.

3) The sample points containing at least one tail (T) are all except HHH which
means {HHT, HTH, HTT, THH,THT,TTH,TTT} = 7.
. Plat leastlT] = i
Example 8. An unbiased dice and an unbiased coin are thrown and tossed
once. Form the probability tree and write down the sample space. Find the
probability of getting 5 on the dice and H on the coin.
Solution: The throwing of a single dice and the tossing of a single coin may be
treated as a two step process. In the first step, 6 possible outcomes are possible
which are {1,2,3,4,5,6}. In the second step, the tossing of the coin will result
in 2 possible outcomes which are H or T. The corresponding probability tree is
shown below: -
