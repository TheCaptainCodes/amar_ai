Preface
The aim of secondary education is to make the learners fits for entry into higher
education by flourishing their latent talents and prospects with a view to building
the nation with the spirit of the Language Movement and the Liberation War.
To make the learners skilled and competent citizens of the country based on the
economic, social, cultural and environmental settings is also an important issue
of secondary education.
The textbooks of secondary level have been written and compiled according to
the revised curriculum 2012 in accordance with the aims and objectives of
National Education Policy-2010. Contents and presentations of the textbooks
have been selected according to the moral and humanistic values of Bengali
tradition and culture and the spirit of Liberation War 1971 ensuring equal
dignity for all irrespective of caste and creed of different religions and sex.
The present government is committed to ensure the successful implementation of
Vision 2021. Honorable Prime Minister, Government of the People’s Republic of
Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm determination to make the country
free from illiteracy and instructed the concerned authority to give free textbooks
to every student of the country. National Curriculum and Textbook Board started
to distributed textbooks free of cost since 2010 according to her instruction.
Mathematics plays an important role in developing scientific knowledge at this
time of the 21st century. Not only that, the application of Mathematics has
increased in family and social life including personal life. With all these things
under consideration Mathematics has been presented easily and nicely at the
Secondary level to make it useful and delightful to the learners, and a good number
of new topics have been included in the textbook.
Considering the challenges and commitments of 21st century and following the
revised curriculum the textbook has been written. The textbook has been revised

Chapter 1
Real Numbers
History of numbers is as old as that of human civilization. Mathematics started
with expressing quantity using numbers. According to Greek Philosopher Aristotle
formal beginning of mathematics started with its practice among ancient Egyptian
priests. So it can be said that number based Mathematics was created some
two thousand years before the birth of Jesus Christ. Numbers and operations on
them have reached today’s universal form after that through the hands of different
nations and civilizations.
Indian mathematicians introduced for the first time the concept of 0 and decimal
number system for satisfying the need of counting natural numbers. This is
considered as a milestone in the representation of numbers. Later on Indian and
Chinese mathematicians expanded the concepts of 0, negative, real, integer and
fractional numbers which were taken as the basis by Arabian mathematicians of
medieval age. Muslim mathematicians of the middle east are given the credit of
expressing numbers using decimal fractions. Again they first introduced
irrational numbers in the form of square roots for solution of quadratic algebraic
equations in llth century. Historians think that around 500 A.D. Greek
philosophers felt necessity of irrational numbers, especially square root of 2, for
the purpose of geometrical drawing. In the nineteenth century European
mathematicians gave completeness to real numbers through introducing
complete set of rules of operations. In order to satisfying daily needs students
are required to have clear understanding about real numbers. In this chapter
real numbers have been discussed in general. At the end of this chapter students
will learn —

Classification of Real Numbers
Natural Number: 1,2,3,4,... etc are natural numbers. 2,3,5,7,... are primes
and 4,6,8,9,... etc are composite numbers. If GCD(Greatest Common Divisor)
of two integers is 1 then they are called mutually primes. For example 6 and 35
are mutually primes since they do not have a common division other than 1.
Integer: All positive and negative fractionless numbers are said to be integers.
For example, ..., —3, —2, —1,0,1,2,3,... etc are integers.
Fractional Number: Numbers expressible as t are said to be factional numbers
13 -5 4
where q # 0 and g # 1 For example, 22 3°6 etc are simple fractional
numbers. In case of a simple fraction ; if p < q then the fraction is called proper
1121
and if p > q then the fraction is termed improper. For example yeaa
3.45 5
etc are proper fractions. yeaa are improper fractions.
Rational Number: Numbers of the form - are called rational when p and q
3 11 5
are integers and q # 0. For example, i= 3, 5 5.5, gm 1.666, ... etc are
rational numbers. Any rational number can be expressed as ratio of two mutually
prime numbers. All integers and fractions are rational numbers.
Irrational Number: If a number cannot be expressed in the form - where p
and q are integers and q # 0, then it is called an irrational number. Root ofa %
natural number not equal to perfect square or its fraction is an irrational number. &

Chapter 1. Real Numbers 3
v5 ae

For example, /2 = 1.414213..., /3 = 1.732..., a= 1.118..., are irrational
numbers. No irrational number can be expressed as ratio of two integers.
Decimal Fractional Number: Rational and irrational numbers when
expressed using aemiiat sign is called decimal fractional number. For example,
3 = 3.0, 2 = 2.5, * = 3.3333..., V3 = 1.732..., ete are decimal fractional
numbers. If there are finite number of digits after decimal sign then this is called
finite decimal fraction and if there are infinitely many digits then it is called
infinite decimal RapHIODE: For example, 0.52, 3.4152 etc are finite decimal
fractions, whereas 3 = 1.333...,.75 = 2.123512367... etc are infinite decimal
fractions. Again, in case of infinite decimal numbers if some degits after decimal
point are repeated they are called infinite repeated decimal fractions. If digits
are not repeated they are called infinite decimal numbers without repeatation.

122 a

For example, ‘ea 1.2323 ...,5.1654 etc are infinite repeated decimal fractions
and 0.523050056..., 2.12340314... ete are infinite decimal numbers without
repeatation.

Real Number: All rational and irrational numbers are called real numbers.
For example, the following numbers are real numbers.

1 3 #4
+1, +2, +3,--- t—,4-,4+-,:-+

0 ? ? a 3, 2 7 2 Z 3 >

V2, V3,V5,V7,-°- 1.23, 0.415, 1.3333..., 0.62, 4.120345061...
Positive Wumber Numbers bigger than 0 are called positive numbers. For
example, 2, Bt 5? V2, 0.415, 0.62, 4.120345061 ..., etc are positive numbers.
Negative Number: Numbers smaller than 0 are called negative numbers. For

1 .

example, —2, ~9 = —/2, —0.415, —0.62, —4.120345061..., etc are negative
numbers.

Non-negative Number: Positive numbers including 0 are called nonnegative
numbers. For example, 0, 3, 979.612, 1.3, 2.120345..., etc are nonnegative
numbers.

Example 1. Find an irrational number between V3 and 4.
Solution: Here, /3 = 1.7320508...
Suppose, a = vara & 2.866 and b = varare we 3.244
Obviously a and b are both real numbers and both are bigger than /3 and smaller
than 4 because a is average of two uneqal numbers V3 and 4, and b is average of
numbers V3, 4 and 4.
That is, V3 < 2.866 < 4 and V3 < 3.244< 4
Again, a and 6 cannot be expressed as fractions.
..@ and 6 are the desired numbers.
In fact we can construct countless such irrational numbers.
Basic characteristics of addition and multiplication processes of real
numbers :
1. Ifa and b are real numbers (i) a+ is a real number and (ii) ab a real
number.
2. Ifa@and bare real numbers (i) a+b =6+<a and (ii) ab = ba
3. Ifa, b, care real numbers (i) (a+b)+c =a+(b+c) and (it) (ab)c = a(be)
4. If ais real number, there are only two real numbers 0 and 1 such that %
(i) 0 #1, (i) a+ 0 =0+a =a and(iii) a-1=1-a=a a

9. If a,b,c are real numbers and a < } then (i) ac < bc whenever c > 0
(ii) ac > be whenever c < 0
Proposition: \/2 is an irrational number.
Proof: Suppose V2 is an irrational number.
Then there are two mutually prime numbers p, q > 1 so that /2 = -
2?
Or, 2= @ [squaring] That is 2g = 7 [Multiplying both sides by gq ]

Obviously 2q is an integer but 7c is not an integer, because p and q are natural
numbers and they are mutually prime and g > 1.

Work: Prove that \/3 is an irrational number.
Example 2. Prove that when one is added to the product of 4 consecutive
natural numbers this is a perfect square.
Solution: Let the consecutive integers be z, +1, r+2, +3
If we add 1 to the product of these 4 integers we get:
a(@+1)(@+2)(2+3)4+1
= 2(4+3)(e@+1)(e@+2)4+1
= (x? + 3z)(z? + 3242) +1

8 =a? +2a+1=(a+1) = (2? + 3a + 1)?

which is a perfect square. Therefore when 1 is added to the product of any four
consecutive natural numbers this is a perfect square.
Decimal Fractions
Each real ghumber son be expressed in decimal fractions. For example,
2 = 2.0, 5 0.4, 37 0.333... etc. Decimal fractions are of three types,
namely: finite, repeated and infinite decimal fractions.
Finite decimal fractions: In any finite decimal fraction there is only a finite
numbers of digits after the decimal point. For example,
0.12, 1.023, 7.832, 54.67, ... etc are finite decimal fractions.
Repeated decimal fractions: In any repeating decimal fraction all or some
digits on the right of decimal point come again and again. For example,
3.333..., 2.454545..., 5.12765765... etc are repeated decimal fractions.
Infinite decimal fractions: In an infinite decimal fraction digits on the right
of decimal point or its part will not appear repeatedly. For example,
1.4142135..., 2.8284271... etc are Infinite decimal fractions.
Remarks: Finite and repeating decimal fractions are rational numbers whereas
infinite decimal numbers are irrational numbers. Value of any irrational number
can be computed to any desired decimal place. If numerator and denominator of
a fraction can be represented by natural numbers then the fraction is a rational
number.
Work: Classify the following numbers with reasons
1.723, 5.2333..., 0.0025, 2.1356124...,0.01050105... and 0.450123...

18° 3 appears over and over again. So
20 3.8333... is a repeating decimal
18 number.

Chapter 1. Real Numbers v
The decimal fraction for which the same digit or a set of digits in order appear
after decimal point is called repeating decimal fraction. The part of the
repeating decimal fraction that appears over and over again is called repeating.
The remaining part is nonrepating.
In a repeating decimal fraction if a single digit repeats then a point is marked
above that digit. Otherwise point is marked on the first and the last repeating
digits. For example, 2.555... is written as 2.5 and 3.124124124... as 3.124.
In a decimal number if every digit after decimal point is repeating then it is called
a pure repeating fraction. Otherwise the fraction is called mixed. For example,
1.3 is a pure repeating fraction and 4.235112 is a mixed repeating fraction.
If in the denominator there are digits other than 2, 5 as a factor then no
numerator will be divisible by that denominator. Since there cannot be any digit
other than 1, 2, ..., 9 at some stage as residue the same numbers will appear.
Number of digits in the repeating part is always less than the number in the
denominator.

Chapter 1. Real Numbers 9

e The repeating decimal fraction has been multiplied with a number equalling
1 followed by as many 0s as many nonrepeating digits are there in the
repeating decimal fraction.

e Subtracting the second number from the first results in a whole number. It
may be noted that nonrepeating part has been subtracted from the repeating
decimal fraction by deleting decimal point and repeating point.

e The result of subtraction has been divided by a number equalling as many
9s as many repeating digits were there in the original repeating decimal
fraction, followed by as many 0 as there were nonrepeating digits after
decimal point.

e In converting repeating decimal fraction into common fraction we have
denominator having as many 9s as many repeating digits followed by as
many Os as many nonrepeating digits after decimal point. Numerator
equals a whole number we get after removing decimal and repeating points
in the fraction less the number obtained by deleting the decimal point and
all digits in the repeating part.

Remarks: Repeating decimal fractions can always be converted to common
fractions. All repeating decimal fractions are rational numbers.
Example 5. Convert 5.23457 into a common fraction.
Sealiettera 5.23457 = 5.234574574577....
5.23457 x 100000 = 523457.457457...

.. The sought fraction is 5749950 ey
Explanation: Since there are 5 digits in the decimal part, the repeating decimal
fraction has been multiplied by 100000 (5 0s after 1). Since there are two decimal
digits before the repeating part 100 (1 followed by 2 0s) repeating decimal fraction
has been multiplied by 100. The second product has been deducted from the first.
On one side of subtraction is a whole number, and in the other the repeating
decimal number multiplied by (100000 — 1000) = 99900. Both sides are divided

by 99900 to obtain the common fraction.
Rules for converting repeating decimal fractions into common
fractions:
Numerator of the desired fraction equals the integer obtained by deleting the
decimal point and subtracting nonrepeating portion after the decimal point.
Denominator is obtained by putting as many 9s as many digits in the repeating
part followed by as many Os in the nonrepeating aprt after the decimal point.
These rules have been applied in the following examples to convert a repeating
decimal fractions into common fractions.
Example 6. Convert 45.2346 into common fraction.

Work: Convert 0.41, 3.04623, 0.012 and 3.3124 into common fractions.
Similar and dissimilar repeating decimal fractions
If for two or more repeating decimal fractions number of digits both in repeating
and nonrepeating parts are the same then they are called similar repeating decimal
fractions. Otherwise they are called dissimilar repeating decimal fractions. For
example, 12.45 and 6.32; 9.453 and 125.897 are similar repeating decimal fractions.
But, 0.3456 and 7.45789; 6.4357 and 2.89345 are dissimilar repeating decimal
fractions.
Converting dissimilar repeating decimal fractions into similar ones
If we write repeating part of a repeating decimal fraction the value does not
change. For example 6.4537 = 6.453737 = 6.45373 = 6.453737. Here each one of 2%
them is a repeating decimal fraction 6.45373737..., which is an infinite decimal 8

will see that all of them are equal.

In order to convert into similar repeating decimal fractions every repeating decimal
must have equal number of digits in nonrepeating part. Repeating part must
have number of digits equal to lowest common multiple of digits in all repeating
parts.
Example 8. Convert 5.6, 7.345, and 10.78423 into similar repeating decimal
fractions.
Solution: Repeating decimal fractions 5.6, 7.345, and 10.78423 have
nonrepeating digits equalling 0, 1 and 2 respectively. Here 10.78423 has the
most number of digits in nonrepeating part, so in order to convert into similar
repeating decimal fractions we must have 2 digits in nonrepeating part of every
number. 5.6, 7.345 and 10.78423 repeating decimal fractions have respectively 1,
2 and 3 digits in the repeating part. LCM of 1, 2 and 3 is 6. So in order to
convert into similar repeating decimal fractions we must have 6 digits in the
repating part of every number. So, 5.6 = 5.66666666, 7.345 = 7.34545454 and
10.78423 = 10.78423423. Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are
respectively 5.66666666, 7.34545454 and 10.78423423.
Example 9. Convert 1.7643, 3.24 and 2.78346 similar repeating decimal
fractions.
Solution: In 1.7643 we have 4 digits in the nonrepeating part and it does not
have repeating part. In 3.24 number of digits in nonrepeating part is 0 and that
of repeating part is 2; in 2.78346 number of digits in nonrepeating part is 2 and
that in repeating part is 3. Here the largest number of nonrepeating digits is 4
and number of digits in the repeating parts are 2 and 3, LCM of which is 6. So
each number must have 4 nonrepating digits and 6 repeating digits.
~. 1.7643 = 1.7643000000, 3.24 = 3.2424242424 2.78346 = 2.7834634634

Remarks: In order to convert finite decimal fractions into similar decimal
fractions we must add sufficient number of 0s at the end of the number to match
with number of nonrepeating digits. In case of repeating decimal fractions for
each number, numbers of nonrepeating digits have been made equal so should be
the case with repating digits.

Work: Convert 3.467, 2.01243 and 7.5256 into similar repeating decimal

fractions.

Addition and subtraction of repeating decimal fractions

In order to add repeating decimal fractions we need to convert them into similar
repeating decimal fractions. Then addition and subtraction must be carried out
as in case of finite decimal fractions. Results thus found will not necessarily be
the right results. In order to obtain the correct value we must add or subtract
from the last digit of the result, the digit in hand when the leftmost repeating
digits were added/subtracted.

Remark:

1. Addition and subtraction of repeating decimal fractions result in repeating
decimal fractions. In addition and subtration result is yet another
repeating decimal fraction having number of nonrepeating digits equalling
the largest/larger number of nonrepeating digits among the numbers
involved in the operation. Number of digits in the repating part equals
LCM of the numbers of digits in the repeating part. In case of finite
decimal fractions the number of digits in the nonrepeating part is matched
with the largest such number among numbers involved in addition or
subtraction by appending appropriate number of 0s at the end.

2. We can also convert repeating decimal fractions into common frcations and
then do addition or subtraction. In this method more additon or subtraction
operations will be necessary.

Example 10. Add 3.89, 2.178 and 5.89798.

Solution: We have 2 digits in nonrepeating part, and repeating parts have
respectively 2, 2 and 3 for which LCM is 6. At first all these three reepating
decimal fractions have been converted into similar repeating decimal x
fractions. “

Chapter 1. Real Numbers 13
3.89 = 3.89898989
2.178 = 2.17878787
5.89798 = 5.89798798
11.97576574 [8+8+7+42 = 25, here 2 is 2 in hands
+2 here 2 of 25 has been added]
11.97576576
Desired result is 11.97576576 or, 11.97576
Remarks: In the result 576576 is repeating part. But if we assume 576 is the
repeating part then there will be no change of value .
Note: In order to clarify addition at the rightmost digit we have solved the
addition in a different way:
3.89 = 3.89898989|89
2.178 = 2.17878787|87
5.89798 = 5.89798798|79
11.97576576|55
Here after the end of repating part some more digits have been taken. These extra
digits have been separated by a vertical line. The addition has been performed.
From the addition of digits just after the vertical line 2 in hands has been added
to the digits just before the vertical line. It may be noted here the digit on the
right side of the vertical line is the same as the first digit of repeatation.
Example 11. Add 8.9478, 2.346 4.71.
Solution: In order to make repeating decimal fractions similar we must have 3
nonrepeating digits and repeating part must have digits equal to LCM of 2 and
3, that is 6. Now decimal fractions will be added.
8.9478 = 8.947847847
2.346 = 2.346000000

The desired result is 2.99669760.
Remarks: If the minuend starting at the repeating dot is smaller than the
subtrahend we must subtract 1 from the rightmost digit.
Note: In the following is explained why 1 is subtracted from the rightmost
digit.
8.243 = 8.24343434|34
5.24673 = 5.24673673|67

Multiplication and division of repeating decimal fractions
If repeating decimal fractions are first converted into common fractions and then
multiplication or division operations are performed we can convert the result
into repeating decimal fractions. If finite decimal fractions and repeating
decimal fractions are multiplied or divided then this rule should be followed.
However, in case of division if both divisor and dividend are repeating decimal
fractions then converting them into similar repeating decimal fractions will ease
the operations.

Infinite decimal fractions
There are many decimal numbers that have infinitely many digits after decimal
point. Moreover, a digit or a number of digits do not repeat as well. These are
called infinite decimal fractions. For example, 5.134248513942301... is an infinite
decimal fraction. Square root of 2 is an infinite decimal fraction. Let us calculate
square root of 2.

In this way the procedure may continue indefinitely. So /2 = 1.4142135... an
infinite decimal fraction.
Value and approximate values up to certain decimal point
It is not the same to calculate an infinite decimal fraction up to decimal places
or approximate it to certain decimal places. For example, 5.4325893... when
calculated up to 4 decimal places will give 5.4325 whereas its approximate value
up to 4 decimal places will give us 5.4326. However, these two values are same
if we calculate up to 2 decimal places. We can do the same for finite decimal
fractions as well.
Remarks: For finding values up to certain decimal places we must write down
those digits exactly as they are. However, for finding approximation up to certain
decimal places we need to check the next digit. If that digit is 5 or more, 1 should
be added to the last position. Otherwise it will be kept in tact.

Sets and Functions
The term ’set’ is well known to us. For example, dinner set, set of natural numbers,
set of rational numbers etc. As a modern concept set has versatile use. The
German mathematician George Cantor (1845-1918) first explained the concept of
set. He introduced the notion of infinite set, and created storm in mathematical
science. His notion is now known as set theory. In this chapter we shall solve
different problems by using concepts of set, diagrams and logic and idea of a
function will also be introduced.
After completion of this chapter the learners will —

sets.

three elements.

diagrams, and apply these rules for solving different problems.
» be able to define relations and functions, and construct them.
> be able to determine domain and range.
» will be able to draw diagrams for functions.
Sets
A set is simply a well organized object of real or imaginary world. For example, %&
the set of three text books of Bangla, English and Mathematics. Some other S

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 23
examples are the set of first 10 odd natural numbers, set of integers, set of real
numbers etc. Sets are usually denoted by the capital letters of English alphabet
like A, B,C,...X,Y, Z.
For example, the set of three numbers 2, 4,6 can be denoted by A = {2, 4, 6}
Each object or member of the set is called its element. For example, if B = {a, b},
to express that a and b are its elements the sign € is used.
..@ € B and we can read as a, is a member of B (a belongs to B)
b € B is a member of 6, (b belongs to B)
The above set B does not contain c. So it is expressed as c ¢ B and is read as c
is not a member of B (c does not belong to B)
Methods for expressing sets
Sets can be expressed using two methods, namely Roster method or tabular

method and Set Builder Method.
Roster method: In this method all members are listed and put inside {} and
if there are more than one element then elements are separated by commas. For
example, A = {a,b}, B = {2,4,6}, C = { Niloy, Shuvro, Tisha } etc.
Set builder method: In this method all elements are not listed rather their
common property is described. For example, A = {x : x is an odd natural number
}, B = {x : « is the first five students of class IX } etc. Here, by ‘: has been
expressed such that. Since in this method element of the set is specified by rules
this method is called Rule Method.
Example 1. Express A = {7, 14, 21, 28} in set building method.
Solution: The elements of A are 7, 14, 21, 28.
Here, each element is a multiple of 7 and not exceeding 28.
.. A= {x : zlis a multiple of 7 and 0 < x < 28}
Example 2. Express B = {z: 2, is a divisor of 28} using roster method.
Solution: Here, 28 = 1 x 28=2x14=4x7

eo «= factors of 28 are 1,2, 4,7, 14, 28

<

S Hence the desired set is B = {1, 2,4, 7, 14, 28}

24 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Example 3. Express C = {x : x positive integer and 2? < 18} using roster
method.
Solution: 1,2,3,4,5,... are positive integers.
Here, if
x =1then, 2? =1?=1;if ¢=2 then, 2? =2? =4
If « = 3 then, 2? = 3? = 9; if x =4 then, x? = 4? = 16
If 2 = 5 then, 2? = 5? = 25 ; which is greater than 18.
.. as per conditions the acceptable positive integers are 1,2,3 and 4.
.. the given set is C = {1,2,3, 4}
Work: Express
1) C= {-9,—6, —3, 3, 6,9} using set building method.
2) Express B = {y: y integer and y*® < 18} using set building method.
Finite Set
The set number of members of which can be determined by counting is called
finite set. For example, D = {x,y,z}, E = {3,6,9,...,60}, F = {x: x prime
and 30 < x < 70} etc are finite sets. Here, set D contains 3 elements, set E 20
elements and set F’ 9 elements.
Infinite Set
The set elements of which cannot be exhausted by counting is called infinite
set. Fo example, A = {x : x odd natural number}, set of natural numbers N =
{1,2,3,4,...}, set of integers Z = {...,—-3,—-2,—-1,0,1,2,3...}, set of rational
numbers Q = {5 : a and b integer and b of, set of rational numbers R etc are
infinite sets.
Example 4. Prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set.
Solution: The set of natural numbers N = {1, 2,3, 4,5, 6,7, 8,...}
The set A = {1,3,5,7,...} consisting of odd natural numbers from the set N
a set B = {2,4,6,8,...} consisting of even natural numbers from the set 2
N

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 25
The set of numbers C = {3,6,9,12,...} multiple of 3 from N
Here, sets consisting of elements from N cannot be determined by counting. As
a result A, B, C are infinite sets.
., N is an infinite set.
Work: Determine which ones are finite and which ones are infinite sets.

1) {3,5,7}

2) {1,2,27,...21}

3) {3,3?,3°,...}

4) {x: a integer and x < 4}

5) C : p and gq are mutually coprimes and g > 1}

6) {y: ye N and y? < 100 < y*}
Empty Set
If a set does not have any element the set is said to be empty set, and is denoted
by @. For example the set of three male students of Viqarunnissa school, {z €
N:10<2< 11}, {c € N: a prime and 23 < x < 29} etc.
Venn-Diagram
John Venn (1834-1923) first expressed sets using pictures. Here every set is
represented by a geometric figure like rectangles, cicrles and triangles in a plane.
These pictures have been named after John Venn.
Subset
A = {a,b} is a set. Sets {a,b}, {a}, {b} can be formed from the elements of set
A. Again, we can form a subset @ with no elements at all. These sets {a,b}, {a},
{b}, @ are subsets of set A. All the sets that can be formed from a set are called
subsets of the original set. Subset is denoted by C. If B is a subset of A then we
write B C A. B is a subset of A. Among the subsets above {a, b} is equal to set
A. Similarly, we can have a subset with no elements at all. ... 2 is a subset of any
set.
Let P = {1,2,3} and Q = {2,3}, R = {1,3} then P, Q and R are subsets of P.
That is, PC P,QC Pand RCP.
Forma-4, Mathematics, Class 9-10

26 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Proper Subset

Of the subsets constructed from a set, the ones that have lesser number of elements
than the original set is called proper set. For example, A = {3,4,5,6} and
B = {3,5} are two sets. Here all elements of B are also elements of A, and
number of elements in A is larger than that of B.

.. B is a proper subset of A and is expressed as B C A.

In the examples of subsets Q and R are each proper subset of P. It may be
mentioned here that @ is a proper subset of any set.

Example 5. Write down the subsets of P = {x,y,z} and identify those that
are proper subsets.

Solution: Given, P = {z, y, z}

Subsets of P are {x,y,z}, {x, y}, {x, z}, {y, z}, {z}, fy}, {z}, o.

Proper subsets of P are {z, y}, {x, z}, {y, z}, {z}, {y}, {z}, 2

Observation: If number of elements of a set is n then it has 2” subsets, and
number of proper subsets is 2” — 1.

Equivalent Set

If two sets have the same elements then they are said to be equivalent sets. For
example, A = {3,5,7} and B = {5, 3,3, 7} are two equivalent sets, then they are
denoted by A = B. Note that A = B if and only if AC Band BCA

Again, if A = {3,5,7}, B = {5,3,3, 7} and C = {7,7,3,5,5} then sets A, B and
C are equivalent sets. That is, A= B=C

Observation: If order of elements in the set are changed or certain element is
repeated set is not changed.

Difference of Sets

Let A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {3,5}. If we delete the elements of set B from
that of A then we get {1,2,4} and is denoted by A\ B or A— B and is read A
delete B.

Example 6. If P={x: isa factor of 12 } and Q = {x:2 isa multiple of 3 &
and z < 12} then determine P — Q. S

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 27
Solution: Given , P = {z: 2 is a factor of 12 }
Here, factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6, 12
.. P = {1,2,3,4,6, 12}
Again, Q = {x : 3 is a factor of z and x < 12}
Here, numbers less than or equal to 12 that are divisible by 3 are 3, 6,9, 12
“. Q = {3,6,9, 12}
The set is: {1, 2,4}
Universal Set
All sets under discussion are subsets of a definite set. For example: the set
A = {x,y} is a subset of the set B = {x,y,z} Here, B set is called as universal
set with respect to set A.
So if all sets under discussion are subsets of a given set then the later set is said
to be universal set with respect to sets under discussion.
Usually universal set is denoted by U. However, other symbols can also be used
to denote universal set.
For example, if set of all even natural numbers is C = {2,4,6,...} and set of
all natural numbers is N = {1,2,3,4,5,6,...} then N will be universal set with
respect to the set C.
Complement of a Set
Let U be universal set and A be a subset of U
U. Then the set of elements outside of A is

Ordered Pair

Amena and Sumena of class VIII occupied 1st and 2nd position repectively in
the annual examination. According to merit this can be expressed as (Amena,

Sumena) pair. Similar definite pairs are called ordered pairs.

So for a pair of elements if the positions are given and expressed then the pair is

called Ordered Pair.

If the first element of an ordered pair is x, and the second element is y then the

ordered pair is denoted by (x,y). For the ordered pairs (x,y) and (a,b) (z,y) =

(a,b) if and only if~ =a andy =6.

Relations
We know Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh, New Delhi is of India and Bangkok
is of Thailand.
There is a relation between capitals and countries. This is country-capital relation.
This relation can be expressed as a set in the following way:

That is country-capital relation = {(Bangladesh, Dhaka ), (India, New Delhi),
(Thailand, Bangkok)}.
If A and B are two sets then nonnull subset R of ordered pairs of their Cartesian

a subset of the set A x B. That is, RC Ax B
Example 15. Let us assume that A = {3,5} and B = {2,4}

For the relation y= 2 +2 3 5

ifs =1 then y =3 9 4

if =2 then y =4 |

if =3 then y=5 1 3

That is there is exactly one value for y for each value of x and z and y are related
by y = 2+ 2. So two variables x and y are related in such a way that for each
value of z there is exactly one value of y. Then y is said to be a function of z.
Usually function of x is denoted by y, f(x), 9(z), F(z).

Let y = x? — 2x + 3 be a function. Here, for each value of x there is exactly one
value of y. Here, both z and y are variables. Although both of them are variables
value of y depends upon the value of x. That is why x is said to be independent
variable and y dependent variable

Domain and Range

For ordered pairs of any relation the set of first elements is said to be domain
and the set of second elements is said to be range.

Let R be a relation from set A to the set B, that is, R C Ax B. For the ordered
pairs of R the set of first elements will be the domain of R and the set of second
elements will be called range of R. The domain of R is denoted by Dom R and &
range by Range R. 8

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 37

Example 20. Find domain and range of the relation

S= {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2); (4, 5)}.

The first elements of the ordered pairs of S are 2,2,3,4 and the second elements

are 1,2,2,5

Dom S = {2,3,4} and Range S = {1,2,5}

Example 21. If A= {0,1,2,3} and R= {(z,y):ceA,yeAandy=2+1}

then express R in tabular method and determine Dom R and Range R.

Graph of a Function

Visual display of a function is said to be graph. In order to clarify the concept

of a function significance of graph is important. French philosopher and

mathematician Rene Descartes (1596-1650) was the first to play pioneering role

in introducing relations between algebra and geometry. He introduced a modern

concept in geometry by defining the position of a point in two dimensional space

by drawing two straight lines perpendicularly crossing to each other. He termed

the perpendicular lines as axes, and their point of intersection as origin. Let two
% perpendicularly crossing straight lines XOX’ and YOY’ be drawn on a plane.
8 Any point lying on this plane can be uniquely determined through these two

38 Mathematics Classes IX-X
straight lines. Each of these perpendicular straight lines is called axis. The line
XOX’ parallel to horizon is called z-axis, and vertical line YOY’ is called
y-axis and point O of intersection of these lines is called Origin.
The signed perpendicular distance of aA point, located in the plane determined by
two axes, from the axes are called coordinates of the point. Let P be any point
on the plane determined by two axes. Let us draw perpendiculars PN and PM
from P to XOX’ and YOY’. Then PM = ON which is perpendicular distance to
YOY’ from P and PN = OM which is perpendicular distance from P to XOX’.
If PM = 2 and PN = y, then coordinates of point P are (z, y).

Here z is called abscissa and y is called ordinate. These coordinates are called
Cartesian coordinates. It is very easy to depict a function using Cartesian
coordinate system. Usually values of independent variable is set along x axis, and
those of dependent variable along y axis.
In order draw a graph for the function y = f(z) some values of independent
variable are chosen from domain, and with corresponding values of dependent
variables are formed ordered pairs. After that these ordered pairs are placed on
the plane. The resultant points are then connected with line which is known as
graph of the function y = f(z).

Algebraic Expressions
Algebraic formulae are used to solve many algebraic problems. Moreover, many
algebraic expressions are presented by resolving them into factors. That is why the
problem solved by algebraic formulae and the contents of resolving expressions into
factors by making suitable for the students have been presented in this chapter.
Moreover, different types of mathematical problems can be solved by resolving
into factors with the help of algebraic formulae. In the previous class, algebraic
formulae and their related corollaries have been discussed elaborately. In this
chapter, those are reiterated and some of their applications are presented through
examples. Besides, extension of the formulae of square and cube, resolution into
factors using remainder theorem and formation of algebraic formulae and their
applications in solving practical problems have been discussed here in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

> expand the formulae of square and cube by applying algebraic formulae

» explain the remainder theorem and resolve into factors by applying the

theorem
» form algebraic formulae for solving real life problems and solve the problems
by applying the formulae.
Algebraic Expressions
Meaningful organization of operational signs and numerical letter symbols is
called Algebraic Expressions. Such as, 2a + 3b — 4c is an algebraic expression.
In algebraic expression, different types of information are expressed through the
letters a, b, c, p, g, T, M,N, Z, y, Zz, ... etc. These alphabet are used to solve
ve different types of problems related to algebraic expressions. In arithmetic, only
8 positive numbers are used, where as, in algebra, both positive and negative

46 Mathematics Classes IX-X
numbers including zero are used. Algebra is the generalization of
arithmetic.
The numbers used in algebraic expressions are constants, their values are
fixed.The letter symbols used in algebraic expressions are variables, their values
are not fixed, they can be of any value.
Algebraic Formulae
Any general rule or resolution expressed by algebraic symbols is called Algebraic
Formula. In class VII and VIII, algebraic formulae and related corollaries have
been discussed. In this chapter, some applications are presented on the basis of
that discussion.
Formula 1. (a+)? =a? + 2ab+ 0?
Formula 2. (a — 6)? = a? — 2ab+ 8?
Remark: It is seen from Formula 1 and Formula 2 that, adding 2ab or —2ab to
a? + 0’, we get a perfect square, ie. we get (a + b)? or (a — b)?. Substituting —b
instead of b in Formula 1 we get Formula 2: {a + (—b)}? = a? + 2a(—b) + (—0)?
That is, (a — 6)? = a? — 2ab+
Corollary 1. a? +b? = (a+b)? — 2ab
Corollary 2. a? +b? = (a— 6b)? + 2ab
Corollary 3. (a+)? = (a—)? + 4ab
Proof: (a + 6)? = a? + 2ab+ 8 = a? — 2ab+ 8? + 4ab = (ab)? +40b O
Corollary 4. (a —)? = (a+b)? — 4ab
Proof: (a — 6)? = a? — 2ab+ b? = a? + 2ab+ b? — 4ab = (a+b)? —4ab O

Remark: By applying the Corollary 6 product of any two quantities can be
expressed as the difference of two squares.
Formula 3. a? — b? = (a+ b)(a — 5)
Therefore, the difference of the squares of two expressions = sum of two expressions
x difference of two expressions.
Formula 4. (z+ a)(z +6) =2?+ (a+b)z + ab
Therefore, (z + a)(x + b) = x?+ (algebraic sum of a and b) z + (the product of a
b)
Extension of formula for square: There are three terms in the expression
a+b+c. It can be considered the sum of two terms (a + b) and c. Therefore, by
applying Formula 1, the square of the expression is,
(a+b4+c) = {(a+b) +c}? = (a+b)? +2(a+bc+e
=a? + 2ab+ 6 + 2ac+ 2be+ 7? = 0? +b? +c? + abt be + ac
Formula 5. (a+b+c)? =a? +'?+c* + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac
20 Corollary 7. a? +0? +c? =(a+b+ 0)? — 2(ab + be + ac)

Resolution into Factors
If an expression is equal to the product of two or more expressions, each of the
latter expressions is called a factor of the former expression. After finding the
possible factors of any algebraic expression and then expressing the expression as
the product of these factors are called factorization or resolution into factors.
The algebraic expressions may consist of one or more terms. So, the factors may
also contain one or more terms. Some process of resolving expressions into factors
Common Factor: If any polynomial expression has common factor in every
term, at first they are to be found out. For example,
Example 18. 3a7b + 6ab? + 12ab* = 3ab(a + 2b + 4ab)
Example 19. 2ab(x — y) + 2be(x — y) + 3ca(z — y) = (a — y)(2ab + 2be + 3ca)
Perfect Square: An expression can be expressed in the form of a perfect
square.
Example 20. Resolve into factors: 42? + 127 + 9
Solution: 42? + 122 + 9 = (2z)? + 2 x 2x x 3+ (3)?

= (2x + 3)? = (2x + 3)(2z + 3)

Difference of two squares: Expressing an expression as the difference of two
squares and then applying the formula a? — b? = (a + b)(a — b).
Example 22. Resolve into factors: a? — 1+ 26 — 6.
Solution: a? — 1+ 2b— 8? = a? — (b? — 2b4+ 1)

Solution: a4 + 646+ = (a)? + (807)?

= (a7)? +2 x a? x 8b? + (867)? — 16a7b?

= (a? + 8b7)? — (4ab)?

= (a? + 8b? + 4ab) (a? + 8b? — 4ab)

= (a? + 4ab + 8b*)(a? — 4ab + 8b)

Work: Resolve into factors:
1) abr? + acaz® + adx* 2) xa? — 1442? 3) x? — Qey — 4y —4

Middle term factorization: Factors can be determined by applying the
formula x? + (a + b)x + ab = (2 + .a)(x +). In this method, a polynomial of the
form x” + px + q can be factorized, if two integers a and b can be found so that,
a+b=pand ab=q. For this, two factors of q with their signs are to be taken
whose algebraic sum is p.If g>0 , a and 6 will be of same sign and if g< 0 , a and
b will be of opposite sign. To be noted p and q may no be integers.
Example 24. Resolve into factors: x? + 122 + 35
Solution: 2? + 122 + 35 = 27+ (5+7)r+5x7=(r+5)(x@+7) co
Example 25. Resolve into factors: x? + x — 20 8

Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 59
Solution: x? + x — 20 = 2? + (5 — 4)z + (5)(—4) = (v7 + 5)(x — 4)
Middle Term Break-Up: By middle term break-up method of polynomial of
the form of ax? + bx +c would be az? + br +c = (rz+p)(sx+q) ifaz?+be+ce=
rsx” + (rq¢+ sp)zx + pq. That is, a = rs, b = rq+sp and c = pg. Hence,
ac = rspq = (rq)(sp) and b = rq+ sp. Therefore, to determine factors of the
polynomial az? + bx + c, ac that is, the product of the coefficient of z? and the
term free from z are to be expressed into two such factors whose algebraic sum is
equal to b, the coefficient of z.

in the form of perfect cube.
Example 27. Resolve into factors: 823 + 3627y + 54ry? + 27y
Solution: 82° + 36z7y + 54ay? + 27y3

Formulae of addition or subtraction of two cubes: Factors can be
determined by applying the formulae a? + b? = (a + b)(a? — ab + 0?)
a? — B = (a — b)(a? + ab +b?)

Remainder Theorem
In the following example, if 6x? — 7z +5 is divided by x — 1 then what is quotient
and remainder?
z—1) 60? —7r +5 (62-1
6x? —6x
—x +5
—“ +1
4
Here, x — 1 is divisor, 6x? — 7x + 5 is divident, 6x — 1 is quotient and 4 is
remainder.
We know, dividend = divisor x quotient + remainder
Now, if we indicate the dividend by f(x), the quotient by h(x), the remainder by
r and the divisor by (x — a), from the above formula, we get,
f(x) = («@-—a)- h(x) +7, this formula is true to all values of a.
Substituting z = a in both sides we get,
f(a) = (a-a)-h(a)+r=0-h(a)+r=r
Hence, r = f(a)
Therefore, if f(x) is divided by (x — a), the remainder is f(a). This formula is
known as remainder theorem. That is, the remainder theorem gives the remainder
when a polynomial f(z) of positive degree is divided by (c—a) without performing
actual division. In the above example if a = 1, then f(r) = 62? — 7z + 5.
.. fl) =6-7+5 = 4 which is equal to the remainder. The degree of the divisor
polynomial (x —a) is 1, If the divisor is a factor of the dividend, the remainder will
be zero and if it is not zero, the remainder will be a number other than zero.
Corollary 11. (« — a) will be a factor of f(x) if and only if f(a) = 0.
Proof: Let, f(a) = 0. Therefore, according to remainder theorem, if f(x) is
divided by (x — a), the remainder will be zero. Hence, (x — a) will be a factor of
F(z).
Conversely, let, (« — a) is a factor of f(z).
Therefore, f(x) = (x — a) - h(x), where h(x) is a polynomial. oo
3
Putting « = a in both sides we get, x

Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 63
f(a) = (a—a) -A(a) =0
«. f(a) =0
Hence, any polynomial f(x) will be divisible by (z — a) if and only if f(a) = 0.
This formula is known as factor theorem. O
Proposition 12. If degree of f(x) is positive and a # 0, then if f(z) is divided
by (ax + 6), the remainder will be f (-z) .
Proof: Degree of divisor az + 6, (a # 0) is 1.
Hence, we can write: f(x) = (az +5)-h(z)+r=a (2 + :) - h(x) +r
b
wf (2) = tte -a-h(z)+r

It is clear that, if f(x) is divided by (« + ?) , the quotient will be a- h(x) and
the remainder will be r.
Here, divisor = x — (-2)
a
Hence, according to remainder theorem r = f (-2)
b
Therefore, if f(x) is divided by (az + b), the remainder will be (-2) Oo
Corollary 13. Ifa ¥# 0, the expression ax +b will be a factor of any polynomial

method of determining the factor using remainder theorem is called Vanishing

Now, putting z = 1,—1 we see that the value of f(x) is not zero.
But, putting x = 2 we see that the value of f(z) is not zero.
Hence, f(2) = 23 -2-6=8-2-6=0
Therefore, z — 2 is a factor of f(z).

subscription per head be Tk. gq.
Then total amount of subscription, Tk A = gx = 45,000 .

Putting the value of g in (2),

(3a — 15) x x = 45000

or, 32? — 152 = 45000

or, x? — 54 = 15000 [dividing both sides by 3]

or, x* — 5a — 15000 = 0

or, 2? — 1254 + 120x — 15000 = 0

or, x(@ — 125) + 120(@ — 125) = 0

or, (x — 125)(x + 120) =0

eo Therefore, (x — 125) = 0 or (x + 120) = 0
SI or, = 125 or, g = —120

the empty tank is filled up in 96 minutes, how much water does the tank contain
?
Solution: Let z litre of water flows in per minute by the first pipe and the tank
can contain y litre of water.
According to the question, the tank is filled up by first pipe in 12 minutes
Again, the empty tank is filled up by the two pipes together in 96 minutes.

Exponents and Logarithms
Very large or very small numbers or expressions can easily be expressed using
exponents. As a result, calculations and solution of mathematical problems
become easier. Scientific or standard form of a number is expressed using
exponents. Therefore, every student should have the knowledge of exponents
and its applications.
Multiplication and division of numbers or expressions and exponent related
calculations have become easier with the help of logarithms. Use of logarithm in
scientific calculations was the only way before calculators and computers became
available. Still the use of logarithm is important as the alternative of calculator
and computer.
In this chapter, exponents and logarithms have been discussed in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

p> Explain the rational exponent.

> explain and apply the positive integral exponents, zero and negative integral

exponents
> solve problems by describing and applying the rules of exponents
> explain the n th root and rational fractional exponents and express the n th
root in terms of exponents

> explain logarithms

> prove and apply the formulae of logarithms

> explain natural logarithm and common logarithm

> explain the scientific form of numbers

> explain the characteristic and mantissa of common logarithm co

> calculate common and natural logarithm by calculator &

Logarithms
Logarithms are used to find the values of exponential expressions. Logarithm
is written in brief as Log. Product, quotient, etc. of large numbers or quantities
can easily be determined with the help of log.
We know, 23 = 8; this mathematical statement is written in terms of log as
log,8 = 3. Again, conversely, if log,8 = 3, it can be written in terms of exponents
as 23 = 8. That is, if 2? = 8 then log,8 = 3 and conversely, if log,8 = 3 then
1 1 J,
23 = 8. Similarly, 2-3 = = gon be written in terms of log as, logs =—-3.
If a® = N,(a>0, a £1) then x = log,N is defined as a based log,N
Note: If a> 0 then a® is always positive whatever may be the values of 2,
positive or negative. So, only the log of positive numbers has values that are real;
log of zero or negative numbers have no real value.

Scientific or Standard Form of Numbers
We can express very large numbers or very small numbers easily using exponents.
Such as, the velocity of light = 300000 km/sec = 300000000 m/sec

= 3 x 100000000 m/sec = 3 x 10° m/sec
Again, the radius of a hydrogen atom

= 0.0000000037 cm

37
=“ _ m= 10710
Too00000000 °™ = 37 x 10 om

= 3.7 x 10 x 107° cm = 3.7 x 10-9 cm
For convenience, very large or very small numbers are expressed in the form a x 10”
where, 1 < a < 10 and n € Z The number of the form a x 10” is called the
scientific or standard form of number.

Work: Express the following numbers in scientific form :

1) 15000 2) 0.000512 3) 123.000512
Logarithmic Methods
Logarithmic systems are of two kinds :

1) Natural Logarithm: Mathematician John Napier (1550-1617) of
Scotland published the first book on logarithms in 1614 by taking e as its
base. e is an irrational number, e = 2.71828.... Such logarithms are called
Napierian logarithms Napierian logarithm or e based logarithm or
natural logarithm. log,z is also written in the form Inz.

2) Common Logarithm: Mathematician Henry Briggs (1561-1630) of
England prepared a table of logarithm (log table) in 1624 with 10 as
the base. This logarithm is called Briggs logarithm or 10 based
logarithm or practical logarithm. This logarithm is written as log, 9x.

Note: If there is no mention of base, in case of algebraic expressions e and in %&
case of numbers 10, are considered the base. In log table 10 is taken as the base. 8

Chapter 4. Exponents and Logarithms 93
Characteristics of Common Log
Let a number N be expressed in the scientific form as
N=ax 10", where N>0,1<a<l0andnéeZ

logigN = log, 9(@ x 10") = log, a + log,,10” = logyga + nlog,)10
J logig = n + logio@ [.." logig10 = 1]
Suppressing the base 10, we have, logN = n+ loga
n is called the characteristic of logN.
Note: It is evident from the table that characteristic of a number having m
digits to the left of decimal point is 1 less than the number of digits to the left of
decimal sign.

Note: Now observe from the following table: If there is no integral part of
a number and the number has k 0’s immediately after decimal point, then the
characteristic of the logarithm of the number is {—(k + 1)}.
If any characteristic is negative, ‘—’ sign is not placed on the left of the
characteristic, rather ‘—’ (bar sign) over the characteristic. Such as,
characteristic —3 will be written as 3. Otherwise, whole part of the log including
mantissa will be negative.

Mantissa of Common Log
Mantissa of Common Logarithm of any number is a non-negative number less than
1. It is mainly an irrational number. But the value of mantissa is determined upto
a certain decimal place. Mantissa of the log of a number can be found from the
log table. Again, it can also be found by calculator. We shall find the mantissa
of the log of any number using 2nd method, that is by calculator.

Equations in One Variable
We have known in the previous class what equation is and learnt its usage. We
have learnt the solution of simple equations with one variable and acquired
knowledge thoroughly about the solution of simple equations by forming
equations from real life problems. In this chapter, linear and quadratic equations
and Identities have been discussed and their usages have been shown to solve the
real life problems.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

>» Explain the conception of variable

>» Explain the difference between equation and identity

> Solve the linear equations

> Solve by forming linear equations based on real life problems

> Solve the quadratic equations and find the solution sets

p> Form the quadratic equations based on real life problems and solve

Variable

We know, 2+ 3 = 5 is an equation. To solve it, we find the value of the unknown
quantity x. Here the unknown quantity x is a variable. Again, to solve the
equation x +a = 5, we find the value of x, not the value of a. Here, x is assumed
as variable and a as constant. In this case, we shall get the values of x in terms
of a. But if we determine the value of a, we shall write a = 5 — x; that is, the
value of a will be obtained in terms of z. Here a is considered a variable and z a
constant. But if no direction is given, conventionally x is considered a variable.
Generally, the small letter x, y, z the ending part of English alphabet are taken as
variables and a,b,c the starting part of the alphabet are taken as constants.
The equation, which contains only one variable, is called a linear equation with %&
one variable. Such as, +3 =5, 2?-5r+b=0, 2y7+5y—3=Oecte. 8

Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 99
We know what the set is. If a set, S = {m: z € R,1 < x < 10}, z-may be any
real number from 1 to 10. Here, z is a variable. So, we can say that when a letter
symbol means the element of a set, it is called variable.
Degree of an equation : ‘The highest degree of a variable in any equation
is called the degree of the equation. Degree of each of the equations z+ 1 =
5, 22-1 =2+5, y+7 = 2y—3 is 1; these are linear equations with one variable.
Again, the degree of each of the equations 27 +52 +6=0, y2-y=12, 4a? —
2x = 3 — 6z is 2; these are linear equations with two variable. The equation
2a3 — g* — 4¢ + 4 =0 is the equation of degree 3 with one variable.
Equation and Identity

Equation: There are two polynomials on two sides of the equal sign of an
equation, or there may be zero on one side (mainly on right hand side). Degree
of the variable of the polynomials on two sides may not be equal. Solving an
equation, we get the number of values of the variable equal to the highest degree
of that variable. This value or these values are called the roots of the equation.
The equation will be satisfied by the root or roots. In the case of more than
one root, these may be equal or unequal. Such as, roots of x? — 52 +6 = 0 are
2,3. Again, though the value of x in equation (z — 3)? = 0 is 3, the roots of the
equations are 3,3.
Identity: There are two polynomials of same (equal) degree on two sides of equal
sign. Identity will be satisfied by more values than the number of highest degree
of the variable. There is no difference between the two sides of equal sign; that is
why, it is called identity. Such as, (x +1)? — (x—1)? = 4z is an identity; it will be
satisfied for all values of x. So this equation is an identity. Each algebraic formula
is an identity. Such as, (a+6)? = a?+2ab+6*, (a—6)? = a?—-2ab+ 6’, a?-8? =
(a+ b)(a—b), (a+b)? = a3 + 3ab + 3ab? + b? etc. are identities.
All equations are not identities, In identity = sign is used instead of (=) sign. But
as all identities are equations, in the case of identity also, generally the equal sign
is used.

1. Ifthe same number or quantity is added to both sides of an equation, two
sides remain equal.
2. Ifthe same number or quantity is subtracted from both sides of an equation,
two sides remain equal.
3. If both sides of an equation are multiplied by the same number or quantity,
the two sides remain equal.
4. If both sides of an equation are divided by same non- zero number or &
quantity, the two sides remain equal. a

Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 101
The rules stated above may be expressed in terms of algebraic expressions as
follows:
Ifz=aandc#0,
(i)t+c=a+e (ii) c-c=a-—c (iit) ze = ac (iv) = =*
Besides, if a,b and c are three quantities, ifa =b+c,a—b=cand ifa+c=6b,
a=b-ce.
This law is known as transposition law and different equations can be solved by
applying this law. If the terms of an equation are in fractional form and if the
degree of the variables in each numerator is 1 and the denominator in each term
is constant, such equations are linear equations.

Now, we shall solve such equations which are in quadratic form. These equations
are transformed into their equivalent equations by simplifications and lastly the
equations is transformed into linear equation of the form az = 6. Again, even
if there are variables in the denominator, they are also transformed into linear
equation by simplification.

Usage of linear equations

In real life we have to solve different types of problems. In most cases of solving

these problems mathematical knowledge, skill and logic are necessary. In real

cases, in the application of mathematical knowledge and skill, as on one side the

problems are solved smoothly, on the other side in daily life, solutions of the

problems are obtained by mathematics. As a result, the students are interested in

mathematics. Here different types of problems based on real life will be expressed

by equations and they will be solved. For determining the unknown quantity in

solving the problems based on real life, variable is assumed instead of the unknown

quantity and then equation is formed by the given conditions. Then by solving

the equation, value of the variable, that is the unknown quantity is found.

Example 5. The digit of the units place of a number consisting of two digits is

2 more than the digit of its tens place. If the places of the digits are interchanged,

the number thus formed will be less by 6 than twice the given number. Find the

number.

Solution: Let the digit of tens place be x.Then the digit of units place will be

o+2.

.. the number is 10x + (# + 2) or, llx +2

Now, if the places of the digits are interchanged, the changed number will be

10(@ + 2) + & or, 11z + 20

By the question, llr + 20 = 2(11z + 2) —6

or, lla +20 = 227 +4-6

or, 22x — 11x = 20+ 6 — 4 [by transposition]

or, llz = 22

or, 7 =2

., the number is lla +2=11x2+2= 24

., given number is 24

Example 6. Ina class if 4 students are seated in each bench, 3 benches remain
se vacant. But if 3 students are seated on each bench, 6 students are to remain
8 standing. What is the number of students in that class ?

104 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Solution: Let the number of students in the class be x
Since, if 4 students are seated in a bench, 3 benches remain vacant, the number
of benches of that class = 7 +3
Again, since, if 3 students are seated in each bench, 6 students are to remain
standing, the number of benches of that class = _
Since the number of benches is fixed,
c x—6 a+12 2-6

therefore Zi +3= 3" on a
or, 4z — 24 = 32 + 36 or, 4x — 32 = 364 24

Example 7. Mr. Kabir, from his Tk 56000, invested some money at the rate
of profit 12% per annum and the rest of the money at the rate of profit 10% per
annum. After one year he got the total profit of Tk. 6400. How much money did
he invest at the rate of profit 12%?
Solution: Let Mr. Kabir invest Tk. x at the rate of profit 12%.
.. he invested Tk. (56000 — x) at the rate of profit 10%.

, “ 12 122
Now, profit of Tk. x in 1 year is Tk. x x 700 or Tk. 700°
Again, profit of Tk. (56000 — x) in 1 year is Tk. (56000 — x) x mn or Tk.
10(56000 — x)

100 :
_ 122  10(56000 — x)
By the question, 00 + 0 > 6400
or, 12z + 560000 — 10z = 640000
or, 2x = 640000 — 560000
or, 2z = 80000
or, x = 40000
.. Mr. Kabir invested Tk. 40000 at the rate of profit 12%.

Quadratic Equations in One Variable

Equations of the form az? + bz + c = 0 [where, a,b,c are constants and a # 0]

is called the quadratic equation with one variable. Left hand side of a quadratic

equation is a polynomial of second degree, right hand side is generally taken to
be zero.

xz is the variable in the equation and highest 12 sqcm &

power of z is 2. Such equation is a quadratic xem

equation. The equation, which has the highest

degree 2 of the variable, is called the quadratic

In class VIII, we have factorized the quadratic expressions with one variable of

the forms x? + px + q and az? + bz +c. Here, we shall solve the equations of the

forms xz? + pr + q = 0 and az? + br +c = 0 by factorizing the left hand side and

by finding the value of the variable.

An important law of real numbers is applied to the method of factorization. The

law is as follows :

If the product of two quantities is equal to zero, either only one of the quantities

or both quantities will be zero.That is, if the product of two quantities a and b

ie., ab = 0, a=0 or, b=0, or both a= 0 and b= 0.

Geometry is an old branch of mathematics. The word ‘geometry’ comes from the
Greek words ‘geo’, meaning the ‘earth’, and ‘metrein’, meaning ‘to measure’. So,
the word ‘geometry’ means ‘the measurement of land’ Geometry appears to
have originated from the need for measuring land in the age of agricultural
based civilization. However, now a days geometry is not only used for measuring
lands, rather knowledge of geometry is now indispensable for solving many
complicated mathematical problems. The practice of geometry is evident in
relics of ancient civilization. According to the historians, concepts and ideas of
geometry were applied to the survey of lands about four thousand years ago in
ancient Egypt. Signs of application of geometry are visible in different practical
works of ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, China and the Incas civilisation. In the
Indian subcontinent there were extensive usages of geometry in the Indus Valley
civilisation. The excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro show the evidence
of that there was a well planned city. For example, the roads were parallel to
each other and there was a developed underground drainage system. Besides the
shape of houses shows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration. In
Vedic period in the construction of altars (or vedis) definite geometrical shapes
and areas were maintained. Usually these were constituted with triangles,
quadrilaterals and trapeziums.
But geometry as a systematic discipline evolved in the age of Greek civilization.
A Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with the first geometrical proof. He
proved logically that a circle is bisected by its diameter. Thales’ pupil Pythagoras
developed the theory of geometry to a great extent. About 300 BC Euclid, a
Greek scholar, collected all the work and placed them in an orderly manner it in
his famous treatise, ‘Elements’. ‘Elements’ completed in thirteen chapters is the
foundation of modern geometry for generations to come. In this chapter, we shall
discuss logical geometry in accordance with Euclid. -

Concepts of space, plane, line and point
The space around us is limitless. It is occupied by different solids, small and large.
By solids we mean the grains of sand, pin, pencil, paper, book, chair, table, brick,
rock, house, mountain, the earth, planets and stars. The concept of geometry
springs from the study of space occupied by solids and the shape, size, location
and properties of the space.
A solid occupies space which is spread in three directions. This spread in three
directions denotes the three dimensions (length, breadth and height) of the solid.
Hence every solid is three dimensional. For example, a brick or a box has three
dimensions (length, breadth and height). A sphere also has three dimensions.
Although the dimensions are not distinctly visible, it can be divided distinctly
into length-breadth-height.

Lh ZW
NY ,
Cot
The boundary of a solid denotes a surface, that is, every solid is bounded by one
or more surfaces. For example, the six faces of a box represent six surfaces. The
upper face of a sphere is also a surface. But the surfaces of a box and of a sphere
are different. The first one is plane while the second is one curved.
Two-dimensional surface: A surface is two dimensional;it has only length and
breadth and is said to have no thickness. Keeping the two dimension of a box
unchanged, if the third dimension is gradually reduced to zero, we are left with a
face or boundary of the box. In this way, we can get the idea of surface from a
solid.

When two surfaces intersect, a line is formed. For example, two faces of a box
meet at one side in a line. This line is a straight line. Again, if a lemon is cut by
a knife, a curved line is formed on the plane of intersection of curved surface of
the lemon.
Line: A line is one-dimensional; it has only length and no breadth or thickness.
If the width of a face of the box is gradually receded to zero, we are left with only
line of the boundary. In this way, we can get the idea of line the from the idea of
surface.
L——————§$?2=< h L6XK SF Os

The intersection of two lines produces a point. That is, the place of intersection
of two lines is denoted by a point. If the two edges of a box meet at a point. A
point has no length, breadth and thickness. If the length of a line is gradually
reduced to zero at last it ends in a point. Thus, a point is considered an entity of
zero dimension.
Euclid’s Axioms and Postulates
The discussion above about surface, line and point do not lead to any definition —
they are merely description. This description refers to height, breadth and length,
neither of which has been defined. We only can represent them intuitively. The
definitions of point, line and surface which Euclid mentioned in the beginning of
the first volume of his ‘Elements’ are incomplete from modern point of view. A
few of Euclid’s axioms are given below:

1. A point is that which has no part

2. A line has no end point

3. A line has only length, but no breath and height

4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself

5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only

6. The edges of a surface are lines

7. A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.
It is observed that in this description, part, length, width, evenly etc have been 2%
accepted without any definition. It is assumed that we have primary ideas about 8

Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 121
them. The ideas of point, straight line and plane surface have been imparted on
this assumption. As a matter of fact, in any mathematical discussion one or more
elementary ideas have to be taken granted. Euclid called them axioms. Some of
the axioms given by Euclid are:

1. Things which are equal to the same thing, are equal to one another.

2. If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.

3. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.

4. Things which coincide with one another, are equal to one another.

5. The whole is greater than the part.
In modern geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane as undefined terms and
some of their properties are also admitted to be true. These admitted properties
are called geometric postulates. These postulates are chosen in such a way that
they are consistent with real conception. The five postulates of Euclid are:
Postulate 1: A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other
point.
Postulate 2: A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.
Postulate 3: A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.
Postulate 4: All right angles are equal to one another.
Postulate 5: If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior
angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the
two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of
angles is less than two right angles.
After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.
Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive
reasoning. The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems.
Euclid is his ‘elements’ proved a total of 465 propositions in a logical chain. This
is the foundation of modern geometry.
Note that there are some incompleteness in Euclid’s first postulate. The drawing
of a unique straight line passing through two distinct points has been ignored.
Postulate 5 is far more complex than any other postulate. On the other hand,
Postulates 1 through 4 are so simple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-
evident truths’. However, it is not possible to prove them. So, these statements
Forma-16, Mathematics, Class 9-10

122 Mathematics Classes IX-X
are accepted without any proof. Since the fifth postulate is related to parallel
lines, it will be discussed later.
Plane Geometry
It has been mentioned earlier that point, straight line and plane are three
fundamental concepts of geometry. Although it is not possible to define them
properly, based on our real life experience we have ideas about them. As a
concrete geometrical conception space is regarded as a set of points and straight
lines and planes are considered the subsets of this universal set. That is,
Postulate 1: Space is a set of all points and plane and straight lines are the
sub-sets of this set.
From this postulate we observe that each of plane and straight line is a set and
points are its elements. However, in ge ometrical description the notation of sets
is usually avoided. For example, a point included in a straight line or plane is
expressed by ‘ the point lies on the straight line or plane’ or ‘ the straight line
or plane passes through the point’. Similarly if a straight line is the subset of a
plane, it is expressed by such sentences as ‘the straight line lies on the plane, or
‘the plane passes through the straight line’.
It is accepted as properties of straight line and plane that,
Postulate 2: For two different points there exists one and only one straight line,
on which both the points lie.
Postulate 3: For three points which are not colinear, there exists one and only
one plane, on which all the three points lie.
Postulate 4: A straight line passing through two different points on a plane lie
completely in the plane.
Postulate 5:

1) Space contains more than one plane.

2) In each plane more than one straight lines lie.

3) The points on a straight line and the real numbers can be related in such a

way that every point on the line corresponds to a unique real number and %
conversely every real number corresponds to a unique point of the line. 8

Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 123
Remarks: The postulates from 1 to 5 are called incidence postulates.
The concept of distance is also an elementary concept. It is assumed that,
Postulate 6:
1) Each pair of points P and Q determines a unique real number which is
known as the distance between point P and @ and is denoted by PQ.
2) If P and Q are different points, the number PQ is positive. Otherwise,
PQ =0.
3) The distance between P and Q and that between Q and P are the same,
ie. PQ=QP.
Since PQ = QP, this distance is called the distance between point P and point
Q. In practical, this distance is measured by previously determined unit.
According to postulate 5(c) one to one correspondence can be established
between the set of points in every straight line and the set of real numbers. In
this connection, it is admitted that,
Postulate 7: One-to-one correspondence can be established between the set of
points in a straight line and the set of real numbers such that, for any points P,Q
, PQ = |a — b| where, the one-to-one correspondence associates points P and Q
to real numbers a and 6 respectively.
If the correspondence stated in this postulate is made, the line is said to have been
reduced to a number line. If P corresponds to a in the number line, P is called
the graph point of P and a the coordinates of P. To convert a straight line into
a number line the co-ordinates of two points are taken as 0 and 1 respectively.
Thus a unit distance and the positive direction are fixed in the straight line. For
this, it is also admitted that,
Postulate 8: Any straight line AB can be converted into a number line such
that the coordinate of A is 0 and that of B is positive.
Remarks: Postulate 6 is known as distance postulate and Postulate 7 as ruler
postulate and Postulate 8 as ruler placement postulate.
Geometrical figures are drawn to make geometrical description clear. The model
of a point is drawn by a thin dot by tip of a pencil or pen on a paper. The model of
a straight line is constructed by drawing a line along a ruler. The arrows at ends
% of a line indicate that the line is extended both ways indefinitely. By postulate 2,
% two different points A and B define a unique straight line on which the two points

124 Mathematics Classes IX-X
lie. This line is called AB or BA line. By postulate 5(c) every such straight line
contains infinite number of points.
According to postulate 5(a@) more than one plane
exist. There is infinite number of straight lines in
every such plane. The branch of geometry that
deals with points, lines and different geometrical
entities related to them, is known as plane Geometry.
In this textbook, plane geometry is the matter of
our discussion. Hence, whenever something is not
mentioned in particular, we will assume that all
discussed points, lines etc lie in a plane.
Proof of Mathematical statements
In any mathematical theory different statements related to the theory are logically
established on the basis of some elementary concepts, definitions and postulates.
Such statements are generally known as propositions. In order to prove correctness
of statements some methods of logic are applied. The methods are:
1. Mathematical Induction
2. Mathematical Deduction
3. Proof by contradiction etc.
Proof by contradiction
Philosopher Aristotle first introduced this method of logical proof. The basis of
this method is:
1. A property cannot be accepted and rejected at the same time.
2. The same object cannot possess opposite properties.
3. One cannot think of anything which is contradictory to itself.
4. Ifan object attains some property, that object cannot unattain that property %

at the same time. N

Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 125
Geometrical proof
In geometry, special importance is attached to some propositions which are
taken, as theorems and used successively in establishing other propositions. In
geometrical proof different statements are explained with the help of figures.
But the proof must be logical.
In describing geometrical propositions general or particular enunciation is used.
The general enunciation is the description independent of the figure and the
particular enunciation is the description based on the figure. If the general
enunciation of a proposition is given, subject matter of the proposition is
specified through particular enunciation. For this, necessary figure is to be
drawn.
Generally, in proving the geometrical theorem the following steps should be
followed :

1. General enunciation.

2. Figure and particular enunciation.

3. Description of the necessary constructions and

4. Description of the logical steps of the proof.
If a proposition is proved directly from the conclusion of a theorem, it is called
a corollary of that theorem. Besides, proof of various propositions, proposals for
construction of different figures are considered. These are known as constructions.
By drawing figures related to problems, it is necessary to narrate the description
of construction and its logical truth.

Line, Ray, Line Segment
By postulates of plane geometry, every point of a straight line lies in a plane. Let
AB be a line in a plane and C be a point on it. The point C is called internal to A
and B if the points A, C and B are different points on a line and AC+C'B = AB.
The points A, C and B are also called collinear points. The set of points including
A and B and all the internal points is known as the line segment AB. The points
between A and B are called internal points.

Angle
When two rays in a plane meet at a point, an angle
is formed. The rays are known as the sides of the
angle and the common point as vertex. In the figure, P
two rays OP and O@ make an angle ZPOQ at their
common point O. O is the vertex of the angle 7POQ.
The set of all points lying in the plane on the Q side 4 7)
of OP and P side of OQ is the known as the interior
region of the ZPOQ. The set of all points not lying
in the interior region or on any side of the angle is x
called exterior region of the angle. “

Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 127
Straight angle
The angle made by two opposite rays at their
common end point is a straight angle. In the adjacent
figure, a ray AC’ is drawn from the end point A of the <————__e—___e>
ray AB. Thus the rays AB and AC have formed an € a #
angle ZBAC at their common point A. ZBAC is a
straight angle. The measurement of a right angle is
2 right angles or 180°.
Adjacent angle
If two angles in a plane have the same vertex, a
common side and the angles lie on opposite sides of - 4
the common side, each of the two angles is said to be
an adjacent angle of the other.
In the adjacent figure, the angles 7BAC and ZCAD
have the same vertex A, a common side AC’ and A D
are on opposite sides of AC. ZBAC and ZCAD are
adjacent angles.
Right angle
If two adjacent angles are on the same line and equal
then each of the related adjacent angle is a right
angle. The two sides of a right angle are mutually
perpendicular. In the adjacent figure two angles Cc
ZBAC and ZDAC are produced at the point A of
BD by the ray AC. C is the vertex of these two
angles.
AC is the common side of the angles ZBAC and * B A D
ZDAC. The angles lie on the opposite sides of the
common side AC. If ZBAC and ZDAC are equal

Acute angle and obtuse angle B c

An angle which is less than a right angle is called an )

acute angle and an angle greater than one right angle _p

but less than two right angles is an obtuse angle. In

the figure, ZAOC is an acute angle and ZAOD is an Oo Z
obtuse angle. Here ZAOB is a right angle.

less than four right angles is called a reflex angle. In p

Supplementary angle

If the sum of two angles is 2 right angles, two angles

are called supplementary angles. C

The point O is an internal point of the line AB. OC

OB. As a result two angles ZAOC and ZCOB are

formed. The measurement of this two angles is equal ‘4 O B

to the measurement of the straight angle ZAOB i.e.,

two right angles. The angles AOC and ZCOB are x
supplementary angles. “

Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 129
Vertical angle

Two angles are said to be the opposite angles if the

sides of one are the opposite rays of the other.

In the adjoining figure OA and OB are mutually “ 2
opposite rays. So are the rays OC and OD. The

angles ZBOD and ZAOC are a pair of opposite oO

angles.

Similarly ZBOC and ZDOA are another pair of c B
opposite angles. Therefore, two intersecting lines

produce two pairs of opposite angles.

Theorem 1. The sum of the two adjacent angles which a ray makes with a
straight line on its meeting point is equal to two right angles.

In the figure, two straight lines AB and C’D are cut by a straight line EF at P
and Q. The straight line EF is a traversal of AB and CD. The traversal has
made eight angles 71, 22, 73, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 with the lines AB and CD.
Among the angles

1) Zland 45, 72 and 46, 23 and 27, 74 and Z8 are corresponding angles.

2) Z3 and 26, 74 and Z5 are alternate angles.

3) 24, Z6 are interior angles on the right.

4) 28, 45 are interior angles on the left.

In a plane two straight lines may intersect or they are parallel. The lines intersect
if there exists a point which is common to both lines. Otherwise, the lines are
parallel. Note that two different straight lines may at most have only one point
in common.

The parallelism of two straight lines in a plane may be defined in three different
ways:

1) The two straight lines never intersect each other ( even if extended to

infinity).

2) Every point on one line lies at equal smallest distance from the other.

3) The corresponding angles made by a transversal of the pair of lines are equal.
According to definition (a) in a plane two straight lines are parallel, if they do
not intersect each other. Two line segments taken as parts of the parallel lines are
also parallel.

According to definition (6) the perpendicular distance of any point of one of the
parallel lines from the other is always equal. Perpendicular distance is the length
of the perpendicular from any point on one of the lines to the other. Conversely, %
if the perpendicular distances of two points on any of the lines to the other are §

Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 131
equal, the lines are parallel. This perpendicular distance is known as the distance
of the parallel lines.
The definition (c) is equivalent to the fifth postulate of Euclid. This definition is
more useful in geometrical proof and constructions.
Observe that, through a point not on a line, a unique line parallel to it can be
drawn.
Theorem 3. When a transversal cuts two parallel straight lines,
1) the pair of corresponding angles are equal.
2) the pair of alternate angles are equal.
3) that pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are

Triangle
A triangle is a figure closed by three line segments. The line segments are known
as sides of the triangle. The point common to any pair of sides is the vertex. The
sides form angles at the vertices.
A triangle has three sides and three angles. Triangles are classified by sides into
three types: equilateral, isosceles and scalene.
By angles triangles are also classified into three types: acute angled, right angled
and obtuse angled.
The sum of the lengths of three sides of the triangle is the perimeter. By triangle
we also denote the region closed by the sides. The line segment drawn from a
vertex to the mid-point of opposite side is known as the median. Again, the
perpendicular distance from any vertex to the opposite side is the height of the %
triangle. 8

If a side of a triangle is produced, a new angle is formed. This angle is known
as exterior angle. Except the angle adjacent to the exterior angle, the two others
angles of the triangle are known as opposite interior angles.

Suppose, (1) AB > AC. Cut from AB a part AD equal to AC. Now, the

triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle. So,

ZADC = ZACD [.: The base angles of an isosceles triangles are equal]

In ADBC exterior angle ZADC > ZABC [.; [Exterior angle is greater

than each of the interior opposite angles]

given condition.

Practical Geometry
In the previous classes geometrical figures were drawn in proving different
propositions and in the exercises. There was no need for precision in drawing
these figures. But sometimes precision is necessary in geometrical constructions.
For example, when an architect makes a design of a house or an engineer draws
different parts of a machine, high precision of drawing is required. In such
geometrical constructions, one makes use of ruler and compasses only. We have
already learnt how to construct triangles and quadrilaterals with the help of
ruler and compasses. In this chapter we will discuss the construction of some
special triangles and quadrilaterals.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

Construction of Triangles
Every triangle has three sides and three angles. But, to specify the shape and
size of a triangle, all sides and angles need not to be specified. For example, as
sum of the three angles of a triangle is two right angles, one can easily find the
measurement of the third angle when the measurement of the two angles of the
triangle given. Again, from the theorems on congruence of triangles it is found that
the following combination of three sides and angles are enough to be congruent.
That is, a combination of these three parts of a triangle is enough to construct a
unique triangle. In class seven we have learnt how to construct triangles from the %&
following data: §

Observe that in each of the cases above, three parts of a triangle have been

can be drawn with the specified angles (which are known as similar triangles).

Sometimes for construction of a triangle three such data are provided by which
we can specify the triangle through various drawing. Construction in a few such
cases is stated below.

sides of a triangle are given. Construct the triangle.
Let the base a, a base adjacent angle 7x and the sum s of the other two sides of
a triangle ABC be given. It is required to construct it.

draw an angle ZCBF = Zz. ya
2. Cut a line segment BD equal to s from the 2 oT

3. Join C,D and at C make an angle DCG ,
equal to ZBDC on the side of DC in which a LE

Alternate Method Let the base a, a base adjacent Zax and the sum s of the
other two sides of a triangle AABC be given. It is required to construct the
triangle.
Drawing:
1. From any ray BE cut the line segment BC

AACR = AADR.
«, AC = AD
Now, In AABC, ZABC = 22, BC =a [by construction]
and BA+-AC = BA+AD = BD =:s. Therefore, AABC is the required triangle.
Construction 2. The base of a triangle, an acute angle adjacent the base and
the difference between the other two sides are given. Construct the triangle.

Construction of Quadrilaterals
We have seen if three independent data are given, in many cases it is possible
to construct a definite triangle. But with four given sides the construction of
a definite quadrilateral is not possible. Five independent data are required for
construction of a definite quadrilateral. A definite quadrilateral can be constructed
if any one of the following combinations of data is known :
1. Four sides and an angle
2. Four sides and a diagonal
3. Three sides and two diagonals
4. Three sides and two included angles
5. Two sides and three angles.
In class VIII, the construction of quadrilaterals with the above specified data has
been discussed. If we closely look at the steps of construction, we see that in some
cases it is possible to construct the quadrilaterals directly. In some cases, the
construction is done by constructions of triangles. Since a diagonal divides the
quadrilateral into two triangles, when one or two diagonals are included in data,
construction of quadrilaterals is possible through construction of triangle.

Sometimes special quadrilaterals can be constructed with fewer data. In such a
cases, from the properties of quadrilaterals, we can retrieve five necessary data.
For example, a parallelogram can be constructed if only the two adjacent sides
and the included angle are given. In this case, only three data are given. Again,
a square can be constructed when only one side of the square is given. The four
sides of a square are equal and an angle is a right angle; so five data are easily
specified.
Construction 4. Two diagonals and an included angle between them of a
parallelogram are given. Construct the parallelogram.
Let, a and 6 be the diagonals of a parallelogram and Zz be an angle included %&
between them. The parallelogram is to be constructed. 8

Therefore, ABCD is a parallelogram with diagonals AC = AO+OC = setae =

Circle
We have already known that a circle is a geometrical figure in a plane consisting
of points equidistant from a fixed point. Different concepts related to circles like
centre, diameter, radius, chord etc have been discussed in previous class. In this
chapter, the propositions related to arcs and tangents of a circle in the plane will
be discussed.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to

p> Explain arcs, angle at the centre, angle in the circle, quadrilaterals inscribed

in the cirlce

» Prove theorems related to circle

p> Application of the theorems to solve many problems related to circle

» State constructions related to circle.
Circle
A circle is a geometrical figure in a plane whose points are equidistant from a
fixed point. The fixed point is the centre of the circle. The closed path traced by
a point that keeps it distance from the fixed centre is a circle. The distance from
the centre is the radius of the circle.
Let, O be a fixed point in a plane and r be a fixed
measurement. The set of points which are at a "
distance r from O is the circle with centre O and ZS)
radius r. In the figure, O is the centre of the circle A B
and A, B and C are three points on the circle. Each
of OA, OB and OC is a radius of the circle.
Some coplanar points are called concylcic if a circle passes through these points,
ie. there is a circle on which all these points lie. In the above figure, the points %
A, B and C are concyclic. 8

Chapter 8. Circle 165
Interior and Exterior of a Circle
If O is the centre of a circle and r is its radius, the set
of all points on the plane whose distances from O are
less than r is called the interior region of the circle
and the set of all points on the plane whose distances
from O are greater than r is called the exterior region R Q
of the circle. The line segment joining two points of
a circle lies inside the circle.
The line segment drawn from an interior point to an exterior point of a circle
intersects a circle at one and only one point. In the figure, P is the interior point
and Q is the exterior point of the circle. The line segment PQ intersects the circle
at R only.
Chord and diameter of a circle
The line segment connecting two different points of
a circle is a chord of the circle. If the chord passes
through the centre it is known as diameter. That
is, any chord forwarding to the centre of the circle is B
diameter. In the figure, AB and AC are two chords Cc
and O is the centre of the circle. The chord AC is
a diameter, since it passes through the centre. OA A
and OC are two radii of the circle. Therefore, the
centre of a circle is the midpoint of any diameter.
The length of a diameter is 2r, where r is the radius
of the circle.
Theorem 17. The line segment drawn from the centre of a circle to bisect a
chord other than diameter is perpendicular to the chord.
Let AB be a chord (other than diameter) of a circle Cc
ABC with center O and M be the midpoint of the
chord. Join O, M. It is to be proved that the line
segment OM is perpendicular to the chord AB. VAN

The arc of a circle
An arc is the piece of the circle between any two
points of the circle. Look at the pieces of the circle
between two points A and B in the figure. We find
that there are two pieces, one comparatively larger
and the other smaller. The larger one is called the
major arc and the smaller one is called the minor
arc. A and B are the terminal points of this arc a 4
and all other points are its internal points. With an R ;
internal fixed point R the arc is called arc ARB and vere
is expressed by the symbol ARB. Again, sometimes
minor arc is expressed by the symbol AB. The two ty dn
points A and B of the circle divide the circle into two minor arc
arcs. The terminal points of both arcs are A and B
and there is no other common point of the two arcs
other than the terminal points.
Arc cut by an Angle
An angle is said to cut an arc of a circle if
1. each terminal point of the arc lies on the sides
of the angle
2. each side of the angle contains at least one
terminal point and A ‘B
3. Every interior point of the arc lies inside the P
angle. The angle shown in the figure cuts the
APB arc of the circle with centre O.

Angle in a Circle (Inscribed angle)

If two chords of a circle meet at a point on the circle

then the angle formed between these chords is called

circular angle or angle inscribed in a circle.

In the figure, ZAC B is an angle in a circle. Every e

angle in a circle cuts an arc of the circle. This arc

may be a major or minor arc or a semi-circle.

The angle in a circle cuts an arc of the circle and

the angle is said to be standing on the cut off arc. A 2

The angle is also known as the angle inscribed in the P

conjugate arc.

In the adjacent figure, the angle stands on the arc

APB and is inscribed in the conjugate arc ACB.

It is to be noted that, APB and ACB are mutually

conjugate.

Remark: The angle inscribed in an arc of a circle is the angle with vertex in
the arc and the sides passing through the terminal points of the arc. An angle
standing on an arc is the angle inscribed in the conjugate arc.

Angle at the Centre (Central angle)

The angle with vertex at the centre of the circle is

called an angle at the centre. An angle at the centre

cuts an arc of the circle and is said to stand on the

arc. In the adjacent figure, ZAOB is an angle at the

centre and it stands on the arc APB. Every angle A

at the centre stands on a minor arc of the circle. In > B

the figure APB is the minor arc. So the vertex of an A

angle at the centre always lies at the centre and the (/ IN

sides pass through the two terminal points of the arc. Cc

To consider an angle at the centre standing on a semi- #

circle the above description is not meaningful. In the a,

case of semicircle, the angle at the centre 7BOC is

a straight angle and the angle on the arc ZBAC isa

right angle.

Theorem 20. The angle subtended by the same arc at the centre is double of %&
the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle. 8

Chapter 8. Circle 171

Given an are BC of a circle subtending angles ZBOC

at the centre O and ZBAC at a point A of the circle A

ABC.

We need to prove that ZBOC = 22BAC

Drawing: Suppose, the line segment AC does not Sy fa

pass through the centre. In this case, draw a line B

segment AD at A passing through the centre.

Proof:

Step 1. In AAOB the external angle 2BOD = ZBAO + ZABO [. An
exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite
angles]

Step 2. In AAOB, OA=OB [." Radius of a circle]

Therefore, 7BAO = ZABO [." Base angles of an isosceles triangle are
equal]

Step 3. From steps (1) and (2), ZBOD = 2ZBAO

Step 4. Similarly, n AAOC ZCOD = 2ZCAO

Step 5. From steps (3) and (4),

ZBOD + ZCOD = 2ZBAO + 2ZCAO [by adding]
This is the same as 7BOC = 2/BAC (Proved)

We can state the theorem in a different way. The angle standing on an arc of the

circle is half the angle subtended by the arc at the centre.

Work: Prove the theorem 20 when AC passes through the centre O of the
circle ABC.

Theorem 21. Angles in a circle standing on the same arc are equal.

having all four vertices on the circle. Such quadrilaterals possess a special property.
The following avtivity helps us understand this property.

the relative position of a circle and a straight linc is shown. 8

Chapter 8. Circle 177
In figure (i) the circle and the straight line PQ have no common point; in figure
(ii) the line PQ is a secant, since it intersects the circle at two points A and B
and in figure (iii) the line PQ has touched the circle at A. PQ is a tangent to the
circle and A is the point of contact of the tangent.
Remark: All the points between two points of intersection of every secants of
the circle lie interior of the circle.
Common tangent
If a straight line is a tangent to two circles, it is
called a common tangent to the two circles. In the
adjoining figures, AB is a common tangent to both \ ,
the circles. In figure (a) and (b), the points of contact ri ms
are different. In figure (c) and (d), the points of (a)
contact are the same.
If the two points of contact of the common tangent
to two circles are different, the tangent is said to be A B

1) direct common tangent if the two centres of the

circles lie on the same side of the tangent and e
2) transverse common tangent, if the two centres
lie on opposite sides of the tangent.

The tangent in figure (c) is a direct common one and iB
in figure (d) it is a transverse common tangent.
If a common tangent to a circle touches both the
circles at the same point, the two circles are said (©)
to touch each other at that point. In such a case,
the two circles are said to have touched internally or
externally according to their centres lie on the same C+)
side or opposite side of the tangent. In figure (c) the
two circles have touched each other internally and in ®
figure (d) externally.
Theorem 25. The tangent drawn at any point of a circle is perpendicular to
the radius through the point of contact of the tangent.

Let PT be a tangent at the point P to the circle with
centre O and OP is the radius through the point of
contact. It is required to prove that, PT 1 OP. A
Construction: Take any point Q on PT and join
T
0, Q. P @Q
Proof: Since PT is a tangent to the circle at the point P, hence every point on
PT except P lies outside the circle. Therefore, the point Q is outside of the circle.
.. OQ is greater than OP that is, OQ > OP and it is true for every point Q on
the tangent PT except P.
.. So, OP is the shortest distance from the centre O to PT.
Therefore, PT 1 OP (Proved)
Corollary 8. At any point on a circle, only one tangent can be drawn.
Corollary 9. The perpendicular to a tangent at its point of contact passes
through the centre of the circle.
Corollary 10. At any point of the circle the perpendicular to the radius is a
tangent to the circle.

Let P be a point outside a circle ABC with centre O 7\
and two line segments PA and PB be two tangents P va
to the circle at points A and B. It is required to prove WW,
that, PA= PB a Cc
Drawing: Join O, A; O, B and O, P.
Proof:
Step 1. Since PA is a tangent and OA is the radius through the point of tangent,

PALOA

.. ZPAO = 1 right angle. [.: The tangent is perpendicular to the

radius through the point of contact of the tangent]

Similarly 7PBO = 1 right angle.

Step 2. Now in the right angled triangles APAO and APBO hypotenuse PO = §

Chapter 8. Circle 179
hypotenuse PO and OA = OB [.: Radius of the same circle]
.. APAO = APBO [Hypotenuse-side unanimity of right angled
triangle]
.. PA= PB (Proved)
Remark:
1. If two circles touch each other externally, all the points of one excepting the
point of contact will lie outside the other circle.
2. If two circles touch each other internally, all the points of the smaller circle
excepting the point of contact lie inside the greater circle.
Theorem 27. If two circles touch each other externally, the point of contact of
the tangent and the centres are collinear.
Let the two circles with centres at A and B touch
each other externally at O. It is required to prove P
that the points A, O, B are collinear.
Drawing: Since the given circles touch each other
at O,they have a common tangent at the point O.
Now draw the common tangent POQ at O and join
O,A and O, B.
Proof:
In the circles with the centre A, OA is the radius through the point of contact of
the tangent and POQ is the tangent.
Therefore ZPOA = 1 right angle. Similarly ZPOB = 1 right angle.
ZPOA+ ZPOB = | right angle + 1 right angle = 2 right angles
Or, ZAOB = 2 right angles
ie. ZAOB is a straight angle.
._ A, O, B are collinear. (Proved)
Corollary 11. _ If two circles touch each other externally, the distance between

Constructions related to circles

Construction 6. To determine the centre of a circle or an arc of a circle. §

Chapter 8. Circle 181
Given a circle as in figure (a) or an arc of a circle as
in figure (b). It is required to determine the centre of
the circle or the arc.
Drawing: In the given circle or the arc of the circle,
three different points A, B and C are taken.
Join A, B and B, C. The perpendicular bisectors Na,
EF and GH of the chords AB and BC are drawn
respectively. Let the bisectors intersect at O.  @: Circle @):Are
Threfore, the O is the required centre of the circle Cc
or of the arc of the circle.
Proof: By construction, the line segment EF is the 4
perpendicular bisector of chord AB and GH is the A ‘B
perpendicular bisector of chord BC’. But both EF se
and GH pass through the centre and their common
point is O. Therefore, the point O is the centre of
the circle or of the arc of the circle.
Tangents to a Circle
We have known that a tangent can not be drawn to a circle from a point internal
to it. If the point is on the circle, a single tangent can be drawn at that point. The
tangent is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the specified point. Therefore,
in order to construct a tangent to a circle at a point on it, it is required to construct
the radius from the point and then construct a perpendicular to it. Again, if the
point is located outside the circle, two tangents to the circle can be constructed.
Construction 7. To draw a tangent at any point of a circle.
Let A be a point of a circle whose centre is O. It is
required to draw a tangent to the circle at the point
A.
Drawing: O, A are joined. At the point A, a
perpendicular AP is drawn to OA. Then AP is the
required tangent.
Proof: The line segment OA is the radius passing ri P
through A and AP is perpendicular to it. Hence AP
is the required tangent.

2° Nota Bene: At any point of a circle only one tangent can be drawn.

S Construction 8. To draw a tangent to a circle from a point outside.

182 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Let P be a point outside of a circle whose centre is

O. A tangent is to be drawn to the circle from the

point P. A
Drawing: (1n

1. Join P,O. The middle point M of the line 17 \
segment PO is determined. P

2. Now with M as centre and MO as radius, a WW,
circle is drawn. Let the new circle intersect the b.
given circle at the points A and B. E

3. Join A, P and B, P.

Then both AP, BP are the required tangents.

Proof: A, O and B, O are joined. PO is the diameter of the circle APB.

.. ZPAO = 1 right angle [.; the angle inscribed in the semi-circle is a right
angle]

So the line segment OA is perpendicular to AP. Therefore, the line segment AP
is a tangent at A to the circle with centre at O. Similarly the line segment BP is
also a tangent to the circle.

Nota Bene: Two and only two tangents can be drawn to a circle from an external
point.

Construction 9. To draw a circle circumscribing a given triangle.

Let ABC be a triangle. It is required to draw a

circle circumscribing it. That is, a circle which passes

through the three vertices A, B and C of the triangle A

is to be drawn. M (NK
Drawing:

1. EM and FN the perpendicular bisectors of AB =e
and AC respectively are drawn. Let the line LPO
segments intersect each other at O. B NY c

2. A,O are joined. With O as centre and radius
equal to OA, a circle is drawn.

Then the circle will pass through the points A, B and C and this circle is the
required circum-circle of AABC.

Proof: B,O and C,O are joined. The point O stands on EM, the perpendicular 2
bisector of AB. &

Chapter 8. Circle 183

..OA = OB, Similarly, OA = OC

“,OA=OB=O0OC

Hence, the circle drawn with O as the centre and OA as the radius passes through

the three points A, B and C. This circle is the required circumcircle of AABC.
Work: In the above figure, the circumcircle of an acute angled triangle is
constructed. Construct the circumcircle of an obtuse and right-angled
triangles.

Notice that for in obtuse-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies outside the

triangle,in acute-angle triangle, the circumcentre lies within the triangle and in

right-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies on the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Construction 10. To draw a circle inscribed in a triangle.

Let AABC be a triangle. It is required to draw is

inscribed circle. i.e. to inscribe a circle in it or to

draw a circle in it such that it touches each of the A

three sides BC,C'A and AB of the triangle AABC.

Drawing: BL and CM, the bisectors respectively F is. E

of the angles ZABC and ZACB are drawn. Let (ser

the line segments intersect at O. OD is drawn LTD

perpendicular to BC from O and let it intersect BC E D —

at D. With O as centre and OD as radius, a circle

is drawn. Then, this circle is the required inscribed

circle.

Proof: From O, OE and OF are drawn perpendiculars respectively to AC and

AB. Let these two perpendiculars intersect the respective sides at EF and F.

The point O lies on the bisector of ZABC.

-.OF =OD

Similarly, as O lies on bisector of ZACB, OF = OD

-.OD = OE = OF

Hence, the circle drawn with centre as O and OD as radius passes through D, E

and F’.

c% Again, OD, OE and OF respectively are perpendiculars to BC, AC and AB at
% their extremities.

184 Mathematics Classes IX-X

Hence, the circle lying inside AABC touches its sides at the points D, E and F

respectively.

Hence, the circle DEF is the required inscribed circle of AABC.

Construction 11. To draw an ex-circle of a given triangle.

Let ABC be a triangle. It is required to draw its

ex-circle. That is, to draw a circle which touches one

side of triangle and the other two sides produced. F

Drawing: Let AB and AC be produced to D and P

F respectively. BM and C'N the bisectors of ZDBC

and ZFCB respectively are drawn. Let FE be their Cc

point of intersection. From EF perpendicular EH is

drawn on BC and let EH intersects BC at H. With A BG D

F as centre and radius equal to FH, a circle is drawn.

The circle HGL is the ex-circle of the triangle ABC.

Proof: From FE perpendiculars EG and EL respectively are drawn to line

segments BD and C’F.Let the perpendicular intersect line segments BD and

CF at the point G and L respectively.

Since F lies on the bisector of ZDBC .. EH = EG

Similarly, the point E lies on the bisector of 7FCB so, EH = EL

. BH =EG=EL

Hence, the circle drawn with F as centre and radius equal to FE passes through

HA, Gand L.

Again, the line segments BC’, BD and CF respectively are perpendiculars at the

extremities of EH, EG and EL.

Hence, the circle touches the three line segments at the three points H,G and L.

Therefore, the circle HGL is the ex-circle AABC.

Remarks: Three ex-circles can be drawn with any triangle.

Work: Construct the two other ex-circles of a triangle.

Trigonometric Ratio
In our day to day life we make use of triangles, and in particular, right angled
triangles. Many different examples from our surroundings can be drawn where
right triangles can be imagined to be formed. In ancient times, with the help
of geometry men learnt the technique of determining the width of a river by
standing on its bank. Without climbing the tree they knew how to measure the
height of the tree accurately by comparing its shadow with that of a stick. In all
the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using some
mathematical technique which come under a special branch of mathematics called
Trigonometry. The word ‘Trigonometry’ is derived from Greek words ‘tri’ (means
three), ‘gon’ (means edge) and ‘metron’ (means measure). In fact trigonometry
is the study of relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle. There are
evidence of using the Trigonometry in Egyptian and Babilonian civilization. It is
believed that the Egyptians made its extensive use in land survey and engineering
works. Early astrologers used it to determine the distances from the Earth to
the farthest planets and stars. At present trigonometry is in use in all branches
of mathematics. There are wide used of trigonometry for the solution of triangle
related problems and in navigation etc. Now a days trigonometry is in wide use
in Astronomy and Calculus.

Naming of sides of a right angled triangle
We know that, the sides of right angles triangle are known as hypotenuse, base
and height. This is successful for the horizontal position of triangle. Again, the
naming of sides is based on the position of one of the two acute angles of right
angled triangle. As for example :
1. ‘(hypotenuse)’,the side of a right angled triangle, which is the opposite side
of the right angle.
2. ‘(opposite side)’, which is the direct opposite side of a given angle.
3. ‘(adjacent side)’, which is a line segment constituting the given angle.
| P
oO N oO N
For the angle ZPON, OP is the
hypotenuse, ON is the adjacent side
and PN is the opposite side. For the
angle ZOPN, OP is the hypotenuse,
PN is the adjacent side and ON is the
opposite side.
In the geometric figure, the capital letters are used to indicate the vertices and
small letters are used to indicate the sides of a triangle. We often use the Greek
letters to indicate angle. Widely used six letters of Greek alphabet are :
theta 8
Greek letter are used in geometry and trigonometry through all the great
mathematician of ancient Greek.

Trigonometric ratios of the angles

Trigonometric ratios of complementary angles
We know, if the sum of two acute angles is 90°, one of them is called
complementary angle to the other. For example, 30° and 60° and 15° and 75° are
complementary angles to each other.
In general, the angles 6 and (90° — @) are complementary angles to each other.
Let ZXOY = @ and P is the point on the side OY ¥
of the angle. We draw PM 1 OX.
Since the sum of the three angles of a triangle is two 3

Trigonometric ratios of the angles 0° and 90°
We have learnt how to determine the trigonometric P
ratios for the acute angle 0 of aright angled triangle. Now,
we see, if the angle is made gradually smaller, how
the trigonometric ratios change. As @ get smaller
the length of the side, PN also gets smaller. The
point P closes to the point N and finally the angle (e) N
8 comes closer to the angle 0°, OP is reconciled with
ON approximately.

When the angle @ comes closer to 0°, the length of the line segment PN reduces to
zero and in this case the value of sin? = op ® approximately zero. At the same
ON
time, the length of OP is equal to the length of ON and the value of cos@ = OP
is 1 approximately.
The angle, 0° is introduced for the convenience of discussion in trigonometry, and
the edge line and the original line of the angle 0° are supposed the same ray.
Therefore, in line with the prior discussion, it is said that, cos0° = 1, sin0° = 0

Again, when the angle @ is very closed to 90°,hypotenuse OP is approximately
equal to PN. So the value of sin@ is approximately 1. n the other hand, if the
angle 6 is equal to 90°, ON is nearly zero; the value of cos@ is approximately 0.
So, in agreement of formulae that are described above, we can say, cos90° = 0,
sin90° = 1

Distance and Elevation
From very ancient times trigonometrical ratios are applied to find the distance and
height of any distant object. At present trigonometrical ratios are of boundless
importance because of its increasing usage. The heights of the hills, mountains
and trees and the widths of those rivers which cannot be measured in ordinary
method are measured with the help of trigonometry. It is necessary to know the
trigonometrical ratios values of acute angles in this regard.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —

p» Explain the geoline, vertical plane and angles of elevation and declination.

» Solve mathematical problem related to distance and height with the help of

trigonometry.
> Measure practically different types of distances and heights with the help of
trigonometry.
Horizontal Line, Vertical Line and Vertical Plane
A horizontal line is a straight line on the horizontal plane. A straight line parallel
to horizon is also called a horizontal line. A vertical line is a line perpendicular
to the horizontal plane. It is also called a normal line. A horizontal line and a
vertical line intersected at right angles on the plane define a plane. It is known as
vertical plane.
A
In the figure, a tree with height of AB is standing vertically
at a distance of CB from a point C on the horizontal plane.
Here, C’B is the horizontal line. BA is the vertical line and
the plane ABC is perpendicular to the horizontal plane which
is a vertical plane.

Algebraic Ratio and Proportion
It is important for us to have a clear conception of ratio and proportion in
mathematics. Arithmetical ratio and proportion have been elaborately discussed
in class VII. In this chapter, algebraic ratio and proportion will be discussed. We
regularly use the concept of ratio and proportion in many applications: the
production of construction materials, food staff and goods , applying fertilizer in
land, making beautiful shapes and design to make things attractive and good
looking, and so on. Many problems of daily lives can also be solved by using the
concept of ratio and proportion.
After studying this chapter, the students will be able to —

> Explain algebraic ratio and proportion.

> Use different types of rules of transformation related to proportion.

» Learn successive proportion.

>» Use ratio, proportion, successive proportion in solving real life problems.
Ratio and Proportion
Ratio

If we have two quantities (or numbers) of the same unit, we can express one

quantity as a multiple (or a fraction) of the other quantity. This fraction is called
the ratio of two quantities. Thus, a ratio says how much of one thing there is
compared to another thing.
The ratio of two quantities p and q is written as p: q = ; These two quantities,
p and q are of same kind and same unit. Here, p is called antecedent and q is 2
called subsequent of the ratio. S

Chapter 10. Distance and Elevation 223
Sometimes we use the ratio as an approximate measure. For example, the number
of cars on the road at 10 A.M. is two times higher than the number of cars at
8 A.M. In this case, it is not necessary to know the exact number of cars to
determine the ratio. Again, in many occasions, we say that the area of your house
is three times to the area of mine. Also in this case, it is not necessary to know
the exact area of the house. We use the concept of ratio in many other cases of
practical life.
Proportion
Let us assume that we have four quantities (or numbers), where the ratio of the
first and the second quantities is equal to the ratio of the third and the fourth
quantities. If a, b, c, d are four such quantities, we writea:b=c:d. It is
noted that the four quantities do not need to be of same kind. However, the two
quantities (a and 6, or c and d) need be of the same kind.
a b
In the above figure, let the bases of two triangles be a and 8, respectively and
both of their height is h unit. If the areas of these triangle are A and B square
units, respectively, we can have the following formulation.
1
A gah a
Br. or, A: B=a: bie. the ratio of two areas is equal to the ratio of
=bh
2
two bases
Continued proportion
Three quantities are said to be in continued proportion; if the ratio between
the first and the second is equal to the ratio between the second and the third.
a,b,c are said to be in continued proportion, if a : 6 = 6: c. Thus, a,b,c will be
continued proportional if and only if b? = ac. In case of continued proportional,
all the quantities are to be of same kinds. In this case, c is called the third
eo Proportional of a and 5, and 0 is called the mid-proportional of a and c.

5 Example 1. A and B traverses the fixed distance in ¢, and t2 minutes. Find

224 Mathematics Classes IX-X
the ratio of the average velocity of A and B
Solution: Let the average velocities of A and B be v, meters and vo metres
per minute, respectively. So, in time ¢, minutes A traverses v,t, meters and in
tg minutes B traverses vot, meters. Thus, we can write as follows. vf, = vote
t
a - = Here, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of

2: 3; Soni’s earning : Samir’s earning = 1500 : 2500 = 3: 5. Hence, Roni’s :
Soni’s : Sami’s earning = 2:3: 5.
If two ratios are of the form a: b and 0: c, they can be re-written in the form
a:b:c. This is called successive ratio. Any two or more ratios can be expressed
in this form. It is noted that if two ratios are to be expressed in the form a: b: c,
the antecedent of the first ratio and the subsequent of the second ratio needs to be
equal. For example, if two ratios 2: 3 and 4: 3 are to be put in the form a: b: c,
the subsequent quantity of the first ratio is to be made equal to the antecedent
quantity of the second ratio. That is, those quantities are to be made equal to
their L.C.M.

Example 14. If the sides of a square increase by 10%, how much will the area
be increased in percentage?
Solution: Let, each side of the square be a metres. Therefore, the area of the
square be a? square metres. If the side of the square increases by 10%, each side
will be (a + a of 10%) metres, or 1.10a metres. In this case, the area of the
square will be (1.10a)? square metres, or 1.21a? square metres. Thus the the area
increases by (1.21a? — a”) = 0.21a? square metres.
0.21a?

.. The percentage of increment of the area will be > x 100% = 21%

the ratio of income from the individual grain.

Proportional Division
Sometimes we need to divide an amount or a quantity up according to a particular
ratio, which is called proportional division. If S is to be divided in a given ratio
a:b:c:d, the we need to first divide S by a+b+c+d, and then the pasts of a,b,c
and d need to be taken. Therefore, 1st part = S' of 4 __...._*# __,
at+tb+c+d at+bt+c+d
b Sb
and part = 5 of atb+c+d a+tb+c+d
c Sc
d part = $ of —————_. = —___

d Sd
4th part = S$ of ——— = —
part = 5 o at+b+c+d at+b+c+d
In this way, any quantity may be divided into any given ratio.

other land are 3: 4 and 2: 3, respectively.
1) What is the area of the given land in square metre?
2) What is the area of the other land?
3) What is the breadth of the given land?
Solution:
1) We know, 1 hector = 10,000 square metres.
., 12 hectors = 12 x 10,000 = 120000 square metres
2) Given that, the ratio of length and breadth of the given land to that of other
land are 3: 4 and 2: 3, respectively.
Let, length of the given land be 32 metres and breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of the other land is 42 metres and breadth is 3y metres.
.. the area of the given land is = 3a - 2y = 6zy square metres and the area
of the other land is = 4x - 3y = 12zy square metres.
According to the given question, 6zy = 120000 or, zy = 20000 .-. the area
of the other land is = 12y = 12 x 20000 = 240000 square metres.
3) Let, the length of the given land be 3z metres and the breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of its one diagonal is \/(3x)? + (2y)? metres.
We get from the previous (b) problem, xy = 20000
According to the question, /(3x)? + (2y)? = 500
or, 9x? + 4y” = 250000
or, (34 + 2y)? — 2- 3a - 2y = 250000
or, (3x + 2y)? — 12ry = 250000
or, (3x + 2y)? — 12 x 20000 = 250000
or, (3x + 2y)? = 250000 + 240000
or, (3x2 + 2y)? = 490000
or, 3a + 2y = 700 --- (1)
c again, (32 — 2y)? = (3x + 2y)* —4-3xr-2y
SI or, (8x — 2y)? = (8a + 2y)? — 24ry

238 Mathematics Classes IX-X
or, (3a — 2y)? = (700)? — 24 x 20000
or, (8x — 2y)? = 490000 — 480000
or, (8x — 2y)? = 10000
or, 3x — 2y = 100... (2)
By subtracting (2) from (1) we get,
4y = 600 or, y = 150
.. the breadth of the given land is 150 metres.

Two Variables
For solving the mathematical problems, the most important topic of Algebra is
equation. In classes VI and VII, we have got the idea of simple equation and
have known how to solve the simple equation with one variable. In class VIII,
we have solved the simple simultaneous equations by the methods of substitution
and elimination and by graphs. We have also learnt how to form and solve simple
simultaneous equations related to real life problems. In this chapter, the idea of
simple simultaneous equations have been expanded and new methods of solution
have been discussed. Besides, in this chapter, solution by graphs and formation
of simultaneous equations related to real life problems and their solutions have
been discussed in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

> Verify the consistency of simple simultaneous equations with two variables.

>» Verify the mutual dependence of two simple simultaneous equations with

two variables
> Explain the method of cross-multiplication
» Form and solve simultaneous equations related to real life mathematical
problems

> Solve the simultaneous equations with two variables by graphs.
Simple simultaneous equations
Simple simultaneous equations means two simple equations with two variables
when they are presented together and the two variables are of same &
characteristics. Such two equations together are also called system of simple 8

Chapter 11. Algebraic Ratio and Proportion 243
equations. In class VIII, we have solved such system of equations and learnt to
form and solve simultaneous equations related to real life problems. In this
chapter, these have been discussed in more details.
First, we consider the equation 2z + y = 12. This is a simple equation with two
variables.
In the equation, can we get such values of x and y on the left hand side for which
the sum of twice the first with the second will be equal to 12 of the right hand
side; that is, the equation will be satisfied by those two values?
Now, we fill in the following chart from the equation
Value of y | Value of L.H.S (2x + y)
-4+16= 12
ee ee Es
ee ee
10+2=12
re rd
The equation has infinite number of solutions. Among those, four solutions are:
(—2, 16), (0,12), (3,6), (5, 2).
Again, we fill in the following chart from another equation x — y = 3:
Value of y | Value of L.H.S (x — y)
-24+5=3

Ps | 0 | 3-0-3 | 3 |
Pape es
The equation has infinite number of solutions. Among those, four solutions are:
(2, —5), (0, -3), (3, 0), (5, 2).
If the two equations discussed above are considered together a system, both the
equations will be satisfied simultaneously only by (5,2). Both the equations will
not be satisfied simultaneously by any other values.
co ‘Therefore, the solution of the system of equations 2x + y = 12 and x —y = 3 is
& (x,y) = (5,2).

244 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Work: Write down five solutions for each of the two equations x—2y+1 = 0
and 2z + y — 3 = 0: so that among the solutions, the common solutions also
exists.

1) As discussed earlier, the system of equations 4 has unique (only
Z-y=
one) solution. Such systems of equations are called consistent. Comparing
the coefficient of z and y (taking the ratio of the coefficients) of the two
2 1
equations, we get, i x Ty) any equation of the system of equations cannot
be expressed in terms of the other. That is why, such systems of equations
are called mutually independent. In the case of consistent and mutually
independent system of equations, the ratios are not equal. In this case, the
constant terms need not to be compared.
. _  2e£-y=6
2) Now we shall consider the system of equations . Can these
4x — 2y = 12
two equations be solved?
Here, if both sides of first equation are multiplied by 2, we shall get the
second equation. Again, if both sides of second equation are divided by
2, we shall get the first equation. That is, the two equations are mutually
dependent.
We know, the first equation has infinite number of solutions. So, the second
equation has also the same infinite number of solutions. Such system of
equations are called consistent and mutually dependent. Such system of
equations have infinite number of solutions. Here, comparing the coefficients
2 -1
of x and y, and the constant terms of the two equations, we get, 4723

That is, in the case of the system of such simultaneous equations, the ratios
become equal.

Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 245
Here, multiplying both sides of first equation by 2, 4% + 2y = 24
second equation is, 4a + 2y = 5
subtracting, 0 = 19 which is impossible.
So, we can say, such systems of equations cannot be solved. Such systems
of equations are inconsistent and mutually independent. Such systems of
equations have no solution.
Here, comparing the coefficients of x and y and constant terms from the two
2 1 =,12
ti ——
equations, we get, 7 = 5 x 5
That is, in case of the system of inconsistent and mutually independent
equations ratios of the coefficients of the variables are not equal to the ratio
of the constant terms.

Solution of simple simultaneous equations
We shall discuss the solutions of only the consistent and independent simple
simultaneous equations. Such system of equation has only one (unique) solution.
Here, four methods of solutions are discussed :

In class VIII, we have known how to solve by the methods of substitution and
elimination. Here, examples of one for each of these two methods are given.
Example 2. Solve by the method of substitution:
22+y=8
32 —2y=5
Solution: Given equations
2a+y=8...(1)
32 — 2y =5...(2)
From equation (1), y = 8 — 2x... (3)
Putting the value of y from equation (3) in equation (2) y we get,
32 — 2(8 — 2x) =5
or, 32 —164+4¢% =5
or, 77 =5+16
or, 7z = 21
or,z=3
Putting the value of x in equation (3) we get,
y=8-2x3
or, y=8-6
or, y=2
.. solution (x,y) = (3, 2)
Substitution method: Conveniently from any of the two equations, value of
one variable is expressed in terms of the other variable and putting the obtained
value in the other equation, we shall get an equation with one variable. Solving
this equation, value of the variable can be found. This value can be put in any
of the equations. But, if it is put in the equation in which one variable has been
expressed in terms of the other variable, the solution will be easier. From this
equation, value of the other variable will be found.
Example 3. Solve by the method of elimination: °o

32 —2y=5
Note: To show the difference between the methods of substitution and
elimination, same equations of example 2 have been taken in this example 3.
Solution: Given equations
2a+y=8...(1)
3a — 2y =5...(2)
Multiplying both sides of equation (1) by 2, 4x + 2y = 16... (3)
Adding (2) and (3),
Tz = 21
or, z=3
Putting the value of z in (1) we get,
2x3+y=8
or, y=8-6
or, y=2
.. solution (x, y) = (3, 2)
Elimination method: Conveniently one equation or both equations are
multiplied by such a number so that after multiplication, absolute values of the
coefficients of the same variable become equal. Then as per need, if the
equations are added or subtracted, the variable with equal coefficient will be
eliminated. Then, solving the obtained equation, the value of the existing
variable will be found. If that value is put conveniently in any of the given
equations, value of the other variable will be found.
Cross multiplication method:
We consider the following two equations:
arc+hytea=0...(1)
aot + boy + co =0...(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by b2 and equation (2) by bi we get,
a, box + bboy + bec, = 0... (3)
a2b1x + bboy + bien = 0... (4)

the method of cross- multiplication.

Solving using Graphical Method
In a simple equation with two variables, the relation of existing variables x and y
and can be expressed by picture. This picture is called the graph of that relation.
In the graph of such equation, there exist infinite number of points. Plotting a
few such points and joining them with each other, we shall get the graph.
Each of a simple simultaneous equations has infinite number of solutions. Graph
of each equation is a straight line. Coordinates of each point of the straight line
satisfies the equation. To indicate a graph, two or more than two points are
necessary.
Now we shall try to solve graphically the following system of equations:
24 +y =3...(1)
4x +2y =6...(2)
From equation (1) we get, y = 3 — 2z.

We observe in the graph, though each of the given equations has separately
infinite number of solutions, they have no common solution as system of
simultaneous equations. Further, we observe that the graphs of the two
equations are straight lines parallel to each other. That is, the lines will never
intersect each other. Therefore, there will be no common point of the lines. In
this case we say, such system of equations has no solution. We know, such
system of equations is inconsistent and independent of each other.
Now, we shall solve the system of two consistent and independent equations by
graphs. Graphs of two such equations with two variables intersect at a point.

Chapter 12. Simple Simultancous Equations in Two Variables 263
Formation of simultaneous equations from real
life problems and solution.
In everyday life, there occur some such mathematical problems which are easier
to solve by forming equations. For this, from the condition or conditions of the
problem, two mathematical symbols, mostly the variables x, y are assumed for
two unknown expressions. Two equations are to be formed for determining the
values of those unknown expressions. If the two equations thus formed are solved,
values of he unknown quantities will be found.
Example 12. If 5 is added to the sum of the two digits of a number consisting
of two digits, the sum will be three times the digits of the tens place. Moreover,
if the places of the digits are interchanged, the number thus found will be 9 less
than the original number. Find the number.
Solution: Let the digit of the tens place of the required number be x and its
digits of the units place is y. Therefore, the number is 10x + y.
.. by the 1st condition, c+ y+5 = 3a... (1)
and by the 2nd condition, 10y + = (102 + y) — 9... (2)
From equation (1) we get, y = 3a —x—5, or, y= 2r—5... (3)
Again, from equation (2) we get,
1l0y-—y+a-—102+9=0
or, 9y — 92 +9=0
or, y—-z+1=0
or, 22 —-5-—2+1=0 [putting the value of y from equation (3) we get]
or,z=4

Finite Series
The term ‘order’ is widely used in our day to day life. For example, the concept
of order is used to arrange the commodities in the shops, to arrange the events of
drama and ceremony, to keep the commodities in attractive way in the godown.
Again, to make many tasks easier and attractive, we use large to small, child to
old, light to heavy etc. types of order. Mathematical series have been originated
from these concepts of order. In this chapter, the relation between sequence and
series and contents related to them have been presented.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —
» Describe the sequence and series and determine the differences between them
» Explain arithmetic finite series
>» Form formulae for determining the fixed term of the series and the sum of
fixed numbers of terms and solve mathematical problems by applying the
formulae
p> Determine the sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers

Sequence
Let us note the following relation:
1 2 3 4 a as n a ae
+ + + 4 1
2 4 6 8 im Qn im
Here, every natural number n is related to twice the number 2n. That means, the
set of positive even numbers {2,4,6,---} is obtained by a method from the set %
of natural numbers {1, 2,3,---}. This arranged set of even number is a sequence. S

Chapter 12. Simple Simultancous Equations in Two Variables 271
Hence, some quantities are arranged in a particular way such that the antecedent
and subsequent terms becomes related. The set of quantities arranged in such a
way is called a sequence.
The aforesaid relation is called a function and written as f(n) = 2n. The general
term of this sequence is 2n. The number of terms of any sequence is infinite. The
way of writing the sequence with the help of general term is:
{2n}, n=1,2,3,-++ or, {2n} 13 or, {2n}
The first quantity of the sequence is called the first term, the second quantity is
called second term, the third quantity is called the third term etc. The first term
of the sequence 1,3,5,7,--- is 1, the second term is 2, etc. Followings are the four
examples of sequence :

Series
If the terms of a sequence are connected successively by + sign, a scrics is
obtained. Such as, 1+3+5+7+--- is a series. The differences between any
two successive terms of the series are equal. Again, 2+4+8+16+--- isa
series. The ratio of two successive terms is equal. Hence, the characterstic of any
% series depends upon the relation between its two successive terms. Among the
8 series, two important series are arithmetic series and geometric series.

272 Mathematics Classes [x-X
Arithmetic Series

If the difference between any term and its antecedent term is always equal, the
series is called arithmetic series.

Example 1. 14+3+4+5+7+9-+11 is a series. The first term of the series is 1,
the second term is 3, the third term is 5 etc.

Here, second term — first term = 3 -1= 2,

third term —second term = 5 — 3 = 2,fourth term — third term = 7 — 5 = 2,
fifth term — fourth term = 9 — 7 = 5,sixth term — fifth term = 11-9 = 2

Hence, the series is an arithmetic series.

In this series, the difference between two terms is called common difference. The
common difference of the mentioned series is 2. The numbers of terms of the
series are fixed. That is why the series is finite series. It is to be noted that if
the terms of the series are not fixed, the series is called infinite series, such as,
1+4+7+10+--- is an infinite series. In an arithmetic series, the first term and
the common difference are generally denoted by a and d respectively. Then by
definition, if the first term is a, the second term is a+ d, the third term is a + 2d
etc. Hence, the series will be a + (a+ d) + (a+ 2d)+---.

Determining common term of an arithmetic series

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be a and the common difference be d.
Then the terms of the series are:

First term =a =a+(1—-1)d

Second term =a+d=a+(2-1)d

Third term =a+ 2d=a+(3-1)d

Fourth term = a+ 3d =a+ (4-—1)d

“nth term = a+ (n—1)d

This n th term is called common term of arithmetic series. If the first term of %
an arithmetic scrics in a@ and common difference is d are known, all the terms of 8

Chapter 13. Finite Series 273
the series can be determined successively by putting n = 1,2,3,4,--- in the n th
term.
Let the first term of an arithmetic series be 3 and the common difference be 2.
Then nth term of the series is = 3+ (n—1) x 2=2n+1.
Work: If the first term of an arithmetic series is 5 and common difference
is 7, determine the first six terms, 22nd term, rth term and (2p + 1)th term.
Example 2. Of the series 5+ 8+11+14+--- which term is 383?
Solution: The first term of the series a = 5, common difference d = 8-5 =
11-—8=14-11=3
.. It is an arithmetic series.
Let, n th term of the series = 383
We know that, n th term = a+(n—1)d
2.a+(n— 1)d = 383
or, 5+ (n — 1)3 = 383
or, 5+ 38n — 3 = 383
or, 3n = 383 -—5+3
or, 3n = 381
or, 2 = 381
3
or, 2 = 127
.. 127 th term of the given series is 383
Sum of n terms of an arithmetic series
Let the first term of any arithmetic series be a, last term be p, common difference
be d, number of terms be 1 and sum of n terms be S,.
Writing from the first term to the last and conversely from the last term to the
first of the series we get

274 Mathematics Classes IX-X

Sp =a+t(atd)+ (at 2d)+-+-+ (p— 2d) + (p—d) +p... (1)

and S, = p+ (p— d) + (p— 2d) +---+ (a+ 2d) + (a+d) +a... (2)

Adding, 28, = (a+p)+ (a+p)+(at+p)+---+(a+p)+(a+p)+(a+p)
or, 2S, = n(a+p) [.: number of terms of the series is n |

SoS = 3a +P) ... (3)
Again, n th term = p = a+ (n-—1)d. Putting this value of p in (3) we get,
Sn = Fla + {a+ (n— 1)d}]
ie, Sp = 5 {2a +(n—1)d} ...(4)
If the first term of an arithmetic series a, last term p and number of terms n are
known, the sum of the series can be determined by the formula (3). But if the
first term a, common difference d and number of terms n are known, the sum of
the series are determined by the formula (4).
Determination of the sum of first n terms of natural numbers
Let S,, be the sum of n-numbers of natural numbers i.e.
Sy, =14+2434---+(n-l1)+n
Writing from the first term and conversely from the last term of the series we get,

S,p=14+2434+---+(n-2)4+(n-1)4+n...()

and S, =n+(n—1)+(n-2)+---4+34+241...(2)

Adding, 2S, = (n+1)+ (n+ 1)+(n+1)+---+(n+1) [n number of terms]
or, 25, = n(n + 1)

n(n+1

Solution: Using formula (3) we get,

Chapter 13. Finite Series 275
.. The sum total of first 50 natural numbers is 1275.
Example 4. 14+2+3+4+---+99 = what?
Solution:
The first term of the series a = 1, common difference d = 2 — 1 = 1 and the last
term p = 99.
.. It is an arithmetic series.
Let the n th term of the series = 9
We know, n th term of an arithmetic progression = a + (n — 1)d
“.a+(n—1)d=99
or, 1+(n-1)1=99
or, l+n-—1=99
“n=99
From (4) formula, the sum of first n-terms of an arithmetic series, S,, = 5 {2a +

Hence, the sum of first 99 terms of the series Sy = 2 x14+ (99-1) x1} =

Example 5. What is the sum of 30 terms of the series 7+ 12+17+---?
Solution: First term of the series a = 7, common difference d = 12 -—7=5
.. It is an arithmetic series. Here, number of terms n = 30
We know that the sum of n- terms of an arithmetic series ,
R= 5 {2a +(n—1)d}

Example 6. Rashid deposits Tk. 1200 from his salary in the first month and in
every month of subsequent months, he deposits Tk. 100 more than the previous
month.
1) Express the aforesaid problem as a series upto n terms.
2) How much does he deposit is the 18 th month and how much does he deposit
in first 18 months?
3) How many years does he need to deposit Tk. 106200?
Solution:
1) As per the question, first term of the arithmetic series, a = 1200, common
difference d = 100
.. second term = 1200 + 100 = 1300
Third term = 1300 + 100 = 1400
.. The series upto n is 1200 + 1300 + 1400+---+n
2) We know, n th term = a+ (n—-1)d
.. deposit in the 18 th month = a+ (18 —1)d = 1200+17 x 100 = 2900 Tk.
Again, summation of first n terms = 5 {2a + (n — 1)d}
.. deposit in first 18 months = Fe x 1200 + (18 — 1) x 100} Tk.
= 9(2400 + 1700) = 36900 Tk.
3) Let, he needs m months to deposit 106200 Tk.
According to the question, 5 {2a + (n — 1)d} = 106200
or, 52 x 1200 + (n — 1) x 100} = 106200
or, n(2400 + 100n — 100) = 212400
or, 100n? + 2300n — 212400 = 0
or, n? + 23n — 2124 =0
or, n? + 59n — 36n — 2124 = 0 eo
or, (n + 59)(n — 36) =0 S

Geometric Series
If the ratio of any term and its antecedent term of any series is always equal i.e.,
if any term divided by its antecedent term, the quotient is always equal, the series
is called a geometric series and the quotient is called common ratio. Such as, of
the series 2+ 4+8-+16-+ 32 the first term is 2, the second term is 4, the third
term is 8, the fourth term is 16 and the fifth term is 32. Here,

: 4
the ratio of the second term to the first term = 37 2

8

the ratio of the third term to the second term = 4 2

F . 16
the ratio of the fourth term to the third term = z= 2

: 32
the ratio of the fifth term to the fourth term = 16 2.
So, this series is a geometric series. In this series, the ratio of any term to its
antecedent term is always equal. The common ratio of the mentioned series is
2. The numbers of terms of the series are finite. That is why the series is finite
geometric series.
The geometric series is widely used in different areas of physical and
biological science, in organizations like Banks and Life Insurance etc,
and in different branches of technology.
If the numbers of terms are not fixed in a geometric series, it is called an infinite
geometric series. The first term of a geometric series is generally expressed by a
and common ratios by r. So by definition, if the first term is a, the second term
is ar, the third term is ar? etc. Hence the series will be a+ ar-+ar?+ar?+---.

General term of a Geometric series
Let the first term of a geometric series be a and common ratio be r. Then, of the
series
First term = a = ar"! Second term = ar = ar?-!
Third term = ar? = ar?“ Fourth term = ar? = ar*-+
nth term = ar”-1
This nth term is called the general term of the geometric series. If the first term
of a geometric series a and the common ratio r are known, any term of the series
can be determined by putting n = 1,2,3,--- etc. successively in the equation of
nth term.

every year for provident fund. At the end of year he deposits 12000 Tk. in a bank

Similarity
The congruence and similarity of triangles have been discussed earlier in class VII.

they are similar; but two similar triangles are not always congruent. S

Equiangular Polygons: If the angles of two polygons with equal number of
sides are sequentially equal, the polygons are known as equiangular polygons.
P D c s R
B c Q R A B P Q
Similar Polygons: If the vertices of two polygons with equal number of sides
can be matched in such a sequential way that
(i) The matching angles are equal and (ii) The ratios of matching sides
are equal, then the two polygons are called similar polygons.
In the above figures, the rectangle ABCD and the square PQRS are equiangular
since the number of sides in both the figures is 4 and the angles of the rectangle
are sequentially equal to the angles of the square (all right angles). Though the
similar angles of the figure are equal, the ratios of the matching sides are not the
same. Hence the figures are not similar. In case of triangles, situation like this
does not arise. As a result of matching the vertices of triangles, if one of the
conditions of similarity is true, the other condition automatically becomes true
and the triangles are similar. That is, similar triangles are always equiangular
and equiangular triangles are always similar.
If two triangles are equiangular and one of their matching pairs is equal, the
triangles are congruent. The ratio of the matching sides of two equiangular
triangles is a constant. Proofs of the related theorems are given below.

Symmetry
Symmetry is an important geometrical concept, commonly exhibited in nature
and is used almost in every field of our activity. Artists, designers, architects,
carpenters always make use of the idea of symmetry. The tree-leaves, the flowers,
the beehives, houses, tables, chairs -everywhere we find symmetrical designs. A
figure has line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded
so that the two parts of the figure will coincide.

Line of symmetry of a regular polygon
A polygon is a closed figure made of several line segments. A polygon is said to be
regular if all its sides are of equal length and all its angles are equal. The triangle
is a polygon made up of the least number of line segments. An equilateral triangle
sx is a regular polygon of three sides. An equilateral triangle is regular because its
® sides as well as angles are equal. A square is the regular polygon of four sides.

304 Mathematics Classes IX-X
The sides of a square are equal and each of the angles is equal to one right angle.

Rotational symmetry
When an object rotates around any fixed point, its shape and size do not change.
But the different parts of the object change their position. If the new position
of the object after rotation becomes identical to the original position, we say the
object has a rotational symmetry. The wheels of a bicycle, ceiling fan, square etc.
are examples of objects having rotational symmetry. As a result of rotation the
blades of the fan looks exactly the same as the original position more than once.
The blades of a fan may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the anticlockwise
direction. The wheels of a bicycle may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the
anticlockwise direction. The rotation in the anti clockwise direction is considered
the positive direction of rotation.
This fixed point around which the object rotates is the centre of rotation. The
angle of turning during rotation is called the angle of rotation. A full-turn means
rotation by 360°; a half-turn is rotation by 180°.
In the figure below, a fan with four blades rotating by 90° is shown in different
positions. It is noted during a complete revolution in four positions (rotating
about the angle by 90°, 180°, 270° and 360°), the fan looks exactly the same. For
this reason, it is said that the rotational symmetry of the fan is order 4.

Here is one more example for rotational symmetry. Consider the intersection of
two diagonals of a square the centre of rotation. In the quarter turn about the
centre of the square, any diagonal position will be as like as the second figure. In
this way, when you complete four quarter-turns, the square reaches its original
position. It is said that a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4.

Observe also that every object occupies same position after one complete
revolution. So every geometrical object has a rotational symmetry of order 1.
For finding the rotational symmetry of an object, one need to consider the
following matter.
1) The centre of rotation
2) The angle of rotation
3) The direction of rotation
4) The order of rotational symmetry.

Line symmetry and rotational symmetry
We have seen that some geometrical shapes have only line symmetry, some have
only rotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational
symmetry. For example, the square has four lines of symmetry as well rotational
symmetry of order 4.
The circle is the most symmetrical figure, because it can be rotated around its
centre through any angle. Therefore, it has unlimited order of rotational of
symmetry. At the same time, every line through the centre forms a line of
reflection symmetry and so it has unlimited number of lines of symmetry.

We know that bounded plane figures may have different shapes. If the region is
bounded by four sides, it is known as quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals have
classification and they are also named based on their shapes and properties.
Apart from these, there are many regions bounded by more than four sides.
These are polygonal regions or simply polygons. Every closed region has a
certain measurement which is called the area of the region. For measurement of
areas usually the area of a square with sides of 1 unit of length is used as the
unit area and their areas are expressed in square units. For example, the area of
Bangladesh is 1.47 lacs square kilometers (approximately). In our day to day life
we need to know and measure areas of polygons for meeting the necessity of life.
So, it is important for the learners to have a comprehensive knowledge about
areas of polygons. Areas of polygons and related theorems and constructions are
presented here.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —
>» Explain the area of polygons
» Verify and prove theorems related to areas
» Construct polygons and justify construction by using given data
> Construct a quadrilateral with area equal to the area of a triangle
> Construct a triangle with area equal to the area of a quadrilateral
Area of a Plane Region
Every closed plane region has definite area. In order to measure such area, usually
the area of a square having sides of unit length is taken as the unit. For example,
the area of a square with a side of length 1 cm. is 1 square centimeter.

The length of a line, the area of a place, the volume of a solid etc. are
determined for practical purposes. In the case of measuring any such quantity,
another quantity of the same kind having some definite magnitude is taken as
unit. The ratio of the quantity measured and the unit defined in the above
process is the amount of the quantity.
18. eepeieads = — Quantity measured
Unit quantity
In the case of a fixed unit, every measure is a number which denotes how many
times the magnitude of the unit is the magnitude of the quantity measured. For
example, the bench is 5 meter long. Here meter is a definite length which is taken
as a unit and in comparison to that the bench is 5 times in length.

Statistics
Owing to the contribution of information and data, the world has become a
global village for the rapid advancement of science and information.
Globalization has been made possible due to rapid transformation and expansion
of information and data. So, to keep the continuity of development and for
participating and contribute in globalization, it is essential for the students at
this stage to have clear knowledge about information and data. In the context,
to meet the demands of students in acquiring knowledge, information and data
have been discussed from class VI and class-wise contents have been arranged
step by step. In continuation of this, the students of this class will know and
learn cumulative frequency, frequency polygon, ogive curve in measuring of
central tendency mean, median, mode etc. in short-cut method.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —

> Explain cumulative frequency, frequency polygon and ogive curve

p> Explain data by the frequency polygon, and ogive curve

» Explain the method of measuring of central tendency

» Explain the necessity of short-cut method in the measurement of central

tendency

p> Find the mean, median and mode by the short-cut method

> Explain the diagram of frequency polygon and ogive curve
Presentation of Data: We know that numerical information which are not
qualitative are the data of statistics. The data under investigation are the raw
materials of statistics. They are in unorganized form and it is not possible to take
necessary decision directly from the unorganized data. It is necessary to organize
and tabulate the data. And the tabulation of data is the presentation of the data.
In previous class we have learnt how to organize the data in tabulation. We know
that it is required to determine the range of data for tabulation. Then determining
the class interval and the number of classes by using tally marks, the frequency

distribution table is made. Here, the methods of making frequency distribution
table are to be re-discussed through example for convenient understanding.
Example 1. In a winter season, the temperature (in celsius) of the month of
January in the district of Srimangal is placed below. Find the frequency
distribution table of the temperature.

14°, 14°, 14°, 13°, 12°, 13°, 10°, 10°, 11°, 12°, 11°, 10°, 9°, 8°, 9°, 11°, 10°, 10°,
8°, 9°, 7°, 6°, 6°, 6°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9°, 9°, 8°, 7°

Solution: Here the minimum and maximum numerical values of the data of
temperature are 6 and 14 respectively.

Hence the range = (14—6)+1=9

If the class interval is considered to be 3, the numbers of class will be 3 or 3
Considering 3 to be the class interval, if the data are arranged in 3 classes, the
frequency table will be:

Temperature (in celcius) | Tally

Work: Form two groups of all the students studying in your class. Find the
frequency distribution table of the weights (in Kgs) of all the members of the
groups.
Cumulative Frequency: In Example 1 considering 3 the class interval and
determining the number of classes, the frequency distribution table has been made.
The number of classes of the mentioned data is 3. The limit of the first class is
6° — 8°. The lowest range of the class is 6° and the highest range is 8°. The
frequency of this class is 11. Similarly, The limit of the second class is 9° — 11°
and the frequency of this class is 13. Now if the frequency 11 of first class is added
to the frequency 13 of the second class, we get 24. This 24 will be the cumulative
frequency of the second class and the cumulative frequency of first class as begins
with the class will be 11. Again, if the cumulative frequency 24 of the second
class is added to the frequency of the third class, we get 24+7 = 31 which isthe 2%
cumulative frequency of the third class. Thus cumulative frequency distribution §

Chapter 17. Statistics 355
table is made. In the context of the above discussion, the cumulative frequency
distribution of temperature in Example 1 is as follows:
Temperature (in oelius)
(i+ 13)=24
12° — 14° (24+ 7) = 31
Example 2. The marks obtained in English by 40 students in an annual
examination are given below. Make a cumulative frequency table of the marks
obtained.
70, 40, 35, 60, 55, 58, 45, 60, 65, 80, 70, 46, 50, 60, 65, 70, 58, 60, 48, 70, 36, 85,
60, 50, 46, 65, 55, 61, 72, 85, 90, 68, 65, 50, 40, 56, 60, 65, 46, 76
Solution:
Range of the data = (highest numerical value — lowest numerical value) + 1 =
(90 — 35) +1=55+1=56
56
Let the class interval be 5 then the number of classes = 5 11.2 or 12 [taking
the immediate next integer when class interval is fractional]
Hence the cumulative frequency distribution table at a class interval of 5 will be
as follows:

% Variable: We know that the numerical information is the data of statistics. The
S numbers used in data are variable. Such as, in example 1 the numbers indicating

356 Mathematics Classes IX-X
temperatures are variable. Similarly, in example 2, the secured marks used in the
data are the variables.
Discrete and Indiscrete variable: The variables used in statistics are of two
types. Such as, discrete and indiscrete vari ables. The variables whose values
are only integers, are discrete variables. The marks obtained in example 2 are
discrete variables. Similarly, only integers are used in population indicated data.
That is why, the variables of data used for population are discrete variables. A
nd the variables whose numerical values can be any real number are indiscrete
variables. Such as, in example 1, the temperature indicated data which can be
any real number. Besides, any real number can be used for the data related to
age, height, weight etc. That is why, the variables used for those are indiscrete
variables. The number between two indiscrete variables can be the value of those
variables. Some times it becomes necessary to make class interval indiscrete. To
make the class interval indiscrete, the actual higher limit of a class and the lower
limit of the next class are determined by fixing mid-point of a higher limit of any
class and the lower limit of the next class. Such as, in example 1 the actual
higher-lower limits of the first class are 8.5° and 5.5° respectively and that of the
second class are 11.5°  8.5° etc.

Work: Form a group of maximum 40 students of your class. Form

frequency distribution table and cumulative frequency table of the group

with the weights/heights of the members.
Diagram of Data: We have seen that the collected data under investigation
are the raw materials of the statistics. If the frequency distribution and
cumulative frequency distribution table are made with them, it becomes clear to
comprehend and to draw a conclusion. If that tabulated data are presented
through diagram, they become easier to understand as well as attractive. That
is why, presentation of statistical data in tabulation and diagram is widely and
frequently used method. In class VIII, different types of diagram in the form of
line graph and histogram have been discussed elaborately and the students have
been taught how to draw them. Here, how frequency polygon, pie-chart, ogive
curve are drawn from frequency distribution and cumulative frequency table will
be discussed.
Frequency Polygon: In class VIII, we have learnt how to draw the histogram
of discrete data. Here how to draw frequency polygon from histogram of indiscrete %
data will be put for discussion through example. 8

1) Draw the histogram of frequency distribution.
2) Draw frequency polygon of the histogram.
Solution: The class interval of the data in the table is discrete. If the class

histogram have been fixed for drawing frequency polygon from histogram.
The mid-points have been joined by line segments to draw the frequency
polygon (shown in the adjacent figure). The mid-points of the first and the

segments successively is frequency polygon.

sides opposite to the base of rectangle of histogram are identified which are the
mid-points of the class. Now the fixed mid-points are joined. The end-points of
the first and the last classes are joined to x-axis representing the class interval to

Central Tendency: Central tendency and its measurement have been discussed
in class VII and VIII. We have seen if the data under investigation are arranged
in order of values, the data cluster round near any central value. A gain if the
disorganized data are placed in frequency distribution table, the frequency is found
to be abundant in a middle class i.e. frequency is maximum in middle class. In
fact, the tendency of data to be clustered around the central value is number
and it represents the data. The central tendency is measured by this number.
Generally, the measurement of central tendency is of three types (1) Arithmetic
means (2) Median (3) Mode :
Arithmetic Mean: We know if the sum of data is divided by the numbers of the
data, we get the arithmetic mean. But this method is complex, time consuming
and there is every possibility of committing mistake for large numbers of data. In
such cases, the data are tabulated through classification and the arithmetic mean
is determined by short-cut method.
Example 7. The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by the
students of a class is as follows. Find the arithmetic mean of the marks.

the mid-value of the class.

Arithmetic mean of classified data (short-cut method): The short-cut
method is easy for determining arithmetic mean of classified data. The steps to
determine mean by short-cut method are :
1. To find the mid-value of classes.
2. To take convenient approximated mean (a) from the mid-values.
3. To determine steps deviation, the difference between class mid-values and
approximate mean are divided by the class interval i.e.
oo mid value — approximate mean
steps deviation we = AAA
class interval
4. To multiply the steps deviation by the corresponding class frequency.
5. To determine the mean of the deviation and to add this mean with 2%
approximate mean to find the required mean. S

Short-cut method: The formula used for determining the mean of the data by
this method is

where, z = required mean, a = approximate mean, f; =class frequency of ith
class, u;f; =-the product of step deviation with class intervals of ith class and h =

Work:
1) Make frequency distribution table of the heights (in cm.) of 49 students
of your class and find the mean without using any formula.
2) From the above problem, deduct the heights of 9 students and then find
the median of heights (in cm.) of 40 students.
Determining Median of Classified Data: If the number of classified data is
n, the value of 3th term of classified data is median. And the formula used to
h
determine the median or the value of sth term is: Median = D+ G - F.) x Fa’
where L is the lower limit of the median class, n is the frequency, F, is the
cumulative frequency of previous class to median class, fi, is the frequency of
median class and A is the class interval.
Example 12. Determine median from the following frequency distribution
table :
30 — 35 | 36 — 41 | 42-47 | 48 — 53 | 54-59 | 60 — 65

1) What is a frequency distribution table?
2) Determine median from the frequency distribution table given above.
3) Draw the frequency polygon of the given data.
Solution:

Here, n = 70 and = = 2 or 35
Therefore, median is the value of 35th term. 35th term lies in the class
(48-53). Hence the median class is (48-53).
oD = 48, F, = 31, fin = 25 and h =6
6 6
So median = 48 + (35 — 31) x m= 48+4x = = 48 + 0.96 = 48.96
Required median 48.96.

3) The table useful to draw the frequency polygon is given below: The median
of the class prior to the first class would be 26.5 and the median of the class
following the last class would be 68.5.

Now, taking convenient units of median values per square unit along the X
axis where, Z\A sign indicates 0 — 26.5 and taking each sqaure unit as two
units of frequency along Y axis the frequency polygon has been drawn.

Work: Make two groups with all the students of your class. (a) Make

a frequency distribution table of the time taken by each of you to solve a

problem, (b) find the median from the table.

Mode:
In class VIII, we have learned that the number which appears maximum times in
a data is the mode of the data. In a data, there may be one or more than one
mode. If there is no repetition of a member in a data, data will have no mode.
Now we shall discuss how to determine the mode of classified data using formula.
Determining Mode of Classified Data: Mode = 1+ Rok x h , where
1t fa

L is the lower limit of mode-class i.e. the class where the mode lies,
fi = frequency of mode-class — frequency of the class previous
fo = frequency of mode class — frequency of next class of mode class and h =class

interval.
Example 13. Following is a table.
31 - 40 | 41-50 | 51-60 | 61-70 | 71-80 | 81-90 | 91-100
Remy | @ [6 | 8 | @ | 9 | 7] 4

1) What is central tendency?

2) Find mode from the above table.

3) Draw ogive curve of the given data.

Solution:

1) Ifthe disorganized data of statistics are arranged according to the value, the
data cluster round near any central value. Moreover, abundance of data is
observed in a single class when these data are presented in some frequency
distribution table. This tendency of data to cluster around central value is
known as central tendency. 2

2) The table to determine mode is given below: 8

Here, the maximum numbers of repetition of frequency is 12 which lies in
the class (61-70).
.D=61, fi =12-8=4, f. =12-9=3,h=10
“, Mode = 61 + += x10=614+ 4x 10-614 2 = 6145.7 = 66.7
4+3 7 7
Required mode 66.7
3) The table to draw the ogive curve is given below:

61-70 60-70
71-80 7-0 | 9 ~+| 9 —~*s

Using convenient scaling along X axis where 7.4 (sign indicates 0 — 30
and taking per square unit as 5 units of cumulative frequency along Y axis
points along higher limits of classes have been marked. Then these marked
points have been joined and thus the Ogive curve has been drawn.

Example 14. Find mode from the frequency distribution table given below.
41 — 50 | 51-60 | 61-70 | 71-80
Frequney| 2 | % | 1% | 8 |
Solution: Here, maximum numbers of frequency are 25 which lie in the class
(41-50). So it is evident that mode is in this class. We know that
Mode= L+ Pare xh. Here, D = 41, fi = 25-0, fo = 25—20 [If the frequency

is maximum in the first class, the frequency of previous class is zero]

«, Mode + a5 ys X10 + 3p * 10 + 8.33 = 49
Required mode 49.33.
Example 15. Find mode from the frequency distribution table given below.
i=] at —30 a—80
Solution: The maximum numbers of Class Frequency frequency are 25 which lie
in the class (41 — 50). So it is obvious that this class is the class of mode. We
fi
know that, Mode = L + ———- xh
Aitfe
Here, L = 41, f; = 25 — 20 =5, fo = 25 —0,h = 10 [If the frequency is maximum ©
in the last class, the frequency of following class is zero] 8

” - 25+5 - 30 7 3 “oe
Required mode 42.67 (approximately)
If the frequency is maximum in the first class, the frequency of previous class is
zero. If the frequency is maximum in the last class, the frequency of following
class is zero.
