Secondly, once the soil's fertility is depleted, the farmer moves to a new area, leading to a cycle of deforestation. This not only contributes to environmental degradation but also leads to loss of habitat for various species. Additionally, with increasing population and pressure on land, the fallow period (the time the land is allowed to recover) decreases, making it difficult for the soil to regain its fertility.

When printing or dyeing clothes with yellow, red, and blue, the resulting colors or the method doesn't directly imply using one of these colors to 'print' in the traditional sense.
