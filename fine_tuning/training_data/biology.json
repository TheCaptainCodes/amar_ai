The number of chromosomes becomes half in the newly developed cell: This occurs in meiosis, not mitosis. Meiosis results in four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.\n- iii. Chromosomes divide once: In both mitosis and meiosis, chromosomes divide once during the process. However, in meiosis, this is followed by a second division without DNA replication.\n\nGiven these explanations:\n- Statement i is correct for mitosis.\n- Statement ii is correct for meiosis.\n- Statement iii is correct for both but in the context of the question, it's essential to identify which type of division is being referred to.\n\nThe correct answer would depend on the type of cell division in Figure A. However, typically:\n- Mitosis involves i and iii.\n- Meiosis involves ii and iii.\n\nThe question seems to be pointing towards a comparison. If Figure A represents mitosis, then i & iii are correct.
